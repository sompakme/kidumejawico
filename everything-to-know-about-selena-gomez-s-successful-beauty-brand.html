She’s solidified herself as a successful singer and actress. But recently, she’s also forayed into the world of makeup and business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Selena launched her first beauty brand, Rare Beauty, with messages of self-acceptance and empowering people. In two short years, the brand has become widely successful and accumulated a million-dollar worth. Selena has a reported net worth of $85 million, and she owes a decent portion of her fortune to Rare Beauty.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk Fires Top Executives After Officially Buying Twitter</a></span></p><p>Despite being so successful, Rare Beauty is still a new company. Here’s everything fans should know about the beauty brand so far.</p><h2 id=selena-launched-rare-beauty-during-the-pandemic>Selena Launched Rare Beauty During The Pandemic</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a difficult time for many businesses, so launching a new brand was a huge risk during the economic uncertainty. But Selena debuted Rare Beauty in September 2020, and despite the timing, the brand has gone on to become a huge success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>I’m SO excited to finally share</a> that Rare Beauty will be launching September 3rd only at Sephora US, Sephora Canada, Sephora Mexico and RareBeauty.com,” Selena wrote in an Instagram post made at the time.</p><p>“I’ve had so much creating everything and can’t wait for y’all to try it all! I hope you love it as much as I do,” she continued.</p><p>Nowadays, Rare Beauty carries a full collection of makeup products, including foundation, blush, lip sticks and glosses, and more.</p><h2 id=selena-s-rare-beauty-made-60-million-in-its-first-year>Selena’s Rare Beauty made $60 Million In Its First Year</h2><p>It takes some brands decades to bring in a million-dollar revenue, btu Selena’s beauty brand accomplished this within its first year. In 2021, it was reported that <a href=#>Rare Beauty was worth a whopping $60 million</a>, only shortly after the brand celebrated its one-year anniversary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rare Beauty is even more popular two years after its founding, having come out with even more products and collaborations. It’s a safe bet that Rare Beauty is worth even more now and is competing with some of the world’s most successful beauty brands.</p><h2 id=rare-beauty-keeps-coming-out-with-new-products-amp-collaborations>Rare Beauty Keeps Coming Out With New Products & Collaborations</h2><p>Much of Rare Beauty’s success can be attributed to its commitment to remain current and relevant. The brand has been consistent in pushing out new products and collaborations, some of which even pay homage to Selena’s other projects.</p><p>In August 2022, fans were thrilled when the brand <a href=#>released an Only Murders in the Building collection</a>, inspired by Selena’s latest show, which just aired its first season. The singer shared a variety of products inspired by her onscreen character, Mabel Mora.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-is-using-rare-beauty-s-profits-for-a-good-cause>Selena Is Using Rare Beauty’s Profits For A Good Cause</h2><p>Selena isn’t the only one profiting from Rare Beauty’s success. When she launched the brand, she revealed that 1% of all sales would go towards the Rare Impact Fund, a charity Selena helped found that “supports organizations that expand access to mental health services in schools and educational settings.”</p><p>When the brand launched, it said it hoped to raise $100 million over the next 10 years specifically for the Rare Impact Fund.</p><p>Rare Beauty’s website also says that it supports other “philanthropic foundations, individuals, corporate partners, and the Rare Beauty community” through its sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Selena has been a big advocate for mental health, often opening up about her own struggles. So, it’s fitting that her beauty brand is partnering with a charity committed to promoting mental health.</p><p>“ <a href=#>Mental health is personal for me</a> . Figuring out how to manage my own mental health hasn't always been easy, but it’s something I am constantly working on and I hope I can help others work on, too,” she explains on the site.</p><p>Some of the products on Rare Beauty’s website say that their full proceeds will go towards Rare Impact. Currently, the all <a href=#>money made from the brand’s Lip Souffle Matte Lip</a> will go towards the charitable organization.</p><p>“Rare Impact is Rare Beauty’s commitment to making a difference in the world,” the site explains. “With a focus on mental health and self-acceptance, Rare Impact aims to support the mental health of their community, employees, and partners around the globe.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, by shopping Selena’s beauty brand, you’re not only supporting her but causes close to her heart.</p><h2 id=but-selena-doesn-t-want-everyone-supporting-rare-beauty>But Selena Doesn’t Want Everyone Supporting Rare Beauty</h2><p>Selena is serious about the messaging behind Rare Beauty. Despite breaking up with Justin Bieber in 2018, she’s continued to be dragged into <a href=#>drama with him and his now-wife, Hailey Bieber</a>. Selena recently addressed the controversy (some fans are convinced Justin cheated on Selena with Hailey), only to tell critics to stop buying her beauty brand.</p><p>In September 2022, she posted a TikTok asking her followers to stop harassing Justin and Hailey on social media, and emphasizing she wants the subject left alone once and for all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=#>If you support Rare, I cannot thank you enough</a>, but know that you are also representing what it means — and that is: Words matter. Truly matter," Selena said, adding, "all about kind words."</p><p>As Selena’s beauty brand grows, so will her messages about kindness and respect.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Fashion Magazine</a>, <a href=#>E!
