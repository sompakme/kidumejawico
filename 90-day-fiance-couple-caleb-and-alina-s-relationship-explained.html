Now, a full 13 years later, they were both interacting on a dating app which paired them as being a good match for one another. As fate would have it, they were connected once again, and this time, it was hard to deny that the world was trying to pair them up. Even the dating app felt they had chemistry between them. Caleb is a 28-year-old operations manager and Alina is a 27-year-old singer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>’90 Day Fiancé’: Unvaccinated Jason Hitch Dead At 45 From COVID-19</a></span></p><h2 id=alina-kasha-39-s-rare-condition-is-revealed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Alina Kasha's Rare Condition Is Revealed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alina has a unique health condition called diastrophic dysplasia. She has revealed that this is indeed a form of dwarfism and that it affects people differently. In Alina's case, she stands shorter than 4-feet, and that is the tallest that she will grow. She has also been candid about the fact that her hands and feet didn't develop normally, and it's hard for her to use them in the manner that others can. Her condition impedes her ability to stand for long periods of time, and she relies on external supports such as her wheelchair.</p><h2 id=things-started-to-heat-up-online><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Things Started To Heat Up Online</span></h2><p>When Alina Kasha and Caleb Greenwood interact online, they're magnetized towards one another. They exchange messages frequently and there is certainly nothing that stands in the way of them continuing to form a close bond with one another. Their conversation between them is fluid, and they are addicted to staying connected with one another. There's an obvious attraction between them, and they both admit that things have really heated up online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-39-re-conscious-of-their-vast-differences><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They're Conscious Of Their Vast Differences</span></h2><p>It's evident that both Alina and Caleb share romantic feelings for one another, and there's an obvious chemistry between them. They share a lot in common, but in spite of all the things they agree on, conversationally, there are some stark differences between them. Alina's health condition is front and center but affects them both in different ways. Alina was afraid that Caleb wouldn't embrace her physical differences when they met in person, and Caleb is conscious of the fact that others may be quick to judge them when they're together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘90 Day Fiancé’: Why Alina And Steven’s Relationship Is Toxic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-met-in-person-for-the-first-time-in-turkey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Met In Person For The First Time In Turkey</span></h2><p>Caleb Greenwood originally planned to meet Alina Kasha in Russia, but covid restrictions got in the way, and they ultimately selected Turkey as the location that they would meet in person for the very first time. The teaser clip for 90 Day Fiancé shows Calebgetting on a plane, and preparing to embark on this exciting adventure, but as they both get psyched up for this all-important meeting, Alina's roommate and best friend, Elijah, embarks on the adventure with her. He's determined to ensure she has a support system in place, in case this meeting doesn't go as planned. Her dwarfism is front-and-center as the meeting with Caleb draws nearer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nerves-kick-in-before-they-meet-in-person><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nerves Kick In Before They Meet In Person</span></h2><p>It's evident that both Alina Kasha and Caleb Greenwood were very nervous about meeting in person for the first time. For so long, they were able to communicate while hiding behind their devices, but when that the moment of in-person connectivity started becoming a reality, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they both felt incredibly uneasy </a>about what would happen next. As she prepared to see Caleb in person for the very first time, Alina said; "my heart is beating fast. I don’t want Caleb to see me just as a little person. I’m more than that and I feel that Caleb and I could spend our lives together. I hope this is the beginning of something amazing and unforgettable for both of us.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=caleb-greenwood-and-alina-kasha-connect-on-many-levels><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Caleb Greenwood And Alina Kasha Connect On Many Levels</span></h2><p>Regardless of their obvious physical differences and the variances in their lifestyle capabilities, Caleb and Alina share a lot of things in common and have discovered a profound connection. They can't get enough of chatting with one another online, and they more they interacted, the greater the buildup was to meet in person and take their relationship to the next level. Alina said she was drawn to Caleb in many ways, but indicated she was thrilled that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> they shared the same personality traits.</a> She said; "our sense of humor is kind of similar, and it's pretty important to have fun and everything. And he also loves traveling, and he's outgoing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiance' Couple Evelyn Cormier And David Vazquez Zermeno Split; Here's Why</a></span></p><h2 id=caleb-puts-the-focus-on-intimacy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Caleb Puts The Focus On Intimacy</span></h2><p>The cameras rolled as they each prepared for their big, in-person meeting, and it was instantly apparent to fans that Caleb had put far more focus on intimacy than Alina did. As he got ready for the big moment, Caleb was seen packing protection and was already launching conversations about intimacy, stating that he was going to spend two weeks with Alina and "anything could happen." It was clear that a physical encounter was fresh on his mind and that he had put some thought into getting up close and personal with Alina pretty quickly. During several interviews, he became quite graphic in his descriptions of what he thought it would be like to share an intimate exchange with Alina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alina-seems-more-emotionally-connected><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Alina Seems More Emotionally Connected</span></h2><p>On the other hand, Alina seemed to be far more emotionally connected to Caleb and was more invested in matters of the heart, than in any sort of physical encounter with him. She was excited to spark an in-person romance and was actively engaged on social media, promoting the December 12th premiere on TLC and teasing fans with what was in store on the show. Caleb, on the other hand, seemed fixated on a physical interaction with Alina, and barely promoted the show at all.</p><h2 id=things-get-a-bit-rocky><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Things Get A Bit Rocky</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Alina's friend, Elijah tags along for their big in-person meeting, it becomes apparent that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this relationship isn't entirely flawless</a>. There are some visibly rocky moments in which Elijah indicates he doesn’t trust Caleb, and fans worry about Caleb's intentions. He seems so fixated on intimacy with Alina that fans believe he is "fetishizing" her. Caleb also shows signs of mistrust and seems frustrated by having a long-distance relationship.
