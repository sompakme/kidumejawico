Moreover, a source <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">claimed to Life and Style that Carrie has gone overboard</a> with the cosmetic enhancements, and is getting obsessive.</p><p>“Carrie’s always been a bit on the vain side, and no one would put it past her to get a few nip/tucks,” the source said. “She appears to have gone a little wild with the lip fillers. They were never that plump before. She probably has a very good dermatologist plus Botox to smooth out the face and neck.”</p><p>With Carrie now 41, the source added, “Carrie doesn’t seem to be showing any signs of age for a 40-something.”</p><p>Moreover, they claimed those around Carrie are growing increasingly concerned. “Of course, the fear is always that someone of Carrie’s caliber will overshoot and ruin her naturally pretty looks,” they explained. “People are hoping she reins it in sooner rather than later.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/simon-cowell-admitted-he-went-too-far-with-surgeries-and-got-a-procedure-completely-removed.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Simon Cowell Not Only Predicted The Contestant That Would Win American Idol, But Also How Many Records They Ended Up Selling">Simon Cowell Not Only Predicted The Contestant That Would Win American Idol, But Also How Many Records They Ended Up Selling</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Simon Cowell reminded everyone that his prediction came true years later.</p><p>Dr. Otto Placik, a Chicago-based plastic surgeon who hasn’t worked with Carrie, also opened up to the publication about what he thinks Carrie has tweaked. “I suspect she’s had her lower eyelids done and a forehead lift, because her eyebrows look higher, as well as fillers or fat to her face and cheeks, which look fuller” the surgeon said.</p><h2 id=carrie-rsquo-s-marriage-is-allegedly-also-in-trouble>Carrie’s Marriage Is Allegedly Also In Trouble</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screen-shot-2023-11-02-at-2-11-19-pm.png><p>Plastic surgery speculation isn’t the only tabloid topics haunting the country star.

One source explained how it caused tension in her marriage, as her husband felt like it was taking her away from their two boys for too long.</p><p>“Mike is not happy Carrie extended her residency. He’s very traditional, and while he loves that Carrie has a career, he believes her role as a wife and mother should be a priority. Mike just wants Carrie to come home.”</p><p>Despite the rumors, the couple have declined to comment on the speculation, and they maintain a united front while Carrie’s Vegas residency continues until October.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrGmucCnm2asn2K4r7vWZq6hmaRitaK8z56lnpxdmK6zvsieZK6mlJq%2FuLvOnapmnpGYsm6vzqedrquZpLtw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./klov-forum-list-of-klov-discussions-and-forums.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./klov-forum-list-of-klov-discussions-and-forums.html>Klov Forum List of Klov Discussions and Forums</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html>Dwayne Johnson's Film Debut Salary Broke A Guinness World Record</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
