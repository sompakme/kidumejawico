As it turned out, the Brazilian model was "getting bored with Herman throughout the date as they didn't have common grounds for conversation." But the outlet also debunked the claims, saying it was all "pure speculation" but that "one thing is confirmed," Brady and Woods "are business partners after the latter signed the former's NFT company, Autograph.</p><p>The stories probably started with Bündchen and Brady's divorce and Herman's lawsuit against Woods. In March, TMZ obtained legal documents stating that Woods' ex-girlfriend – who has a law degree – was fighting to nullify her NDA and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sue her ex for sexual harassment</a>. Her attorneys claimed that the athlete "forced her to sign an NDA" in 2017 or else she would "be fired from her job."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Herman's team argued that Woods, "a boss imposing different work conditions on his employee because of their sexual relationship is sexual harassment."</p><p>The hospitality professional also accused Woods of kicking her out of their home. "The landlord made the availability of her housing conditional on her having sexual relationship with a co-tenant," her lawyers wrote in a court filing. "That conduct amounts to sexual harassment under federal and Florida fair housing laws." In November 2023, Herman eventually dropped the charges, saying she was "never a victim of sexual harassment or sexual abuse at the hands of Tiger Woods," despite her initial filing.</p><p>Erica Herman's lawsuit was filed against Tiger Woods' trust that owns his $54 million Florida mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nike-s-partnership-with-tiger-woods-proved-to-be-the-final-straw-that-ended-his-marriage-with-elin-nordegren-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tiger Woods Sent A Problematic Text Just Minutes After Elin Nordegren Found Out About HIs Mistress</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tiger Woods still wanted to keep his affair the night before Elin Nordegren smashed his car windows with a golf club.</span><h2 id=tiger-woods-39-ex-girlfriend-lindsey-vonn-was-intimidated-by-gisele-b-uuml-ndchen>Tiger Woods' Ex-Girlfriend Lindsey Vonn Was Intimidated By Gisele Bündchen</h2><p>Bündchen also had an encounter with another ex of Woods'. In 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she worked with Vonn for an Under Armour campaign</a>. In an interview with Elle, the Olympic ski racer said she was "intimidated" by the Chanel ambassador back then. "This morning on Good Morning America I was so intimidated," Vonn shared. "I told her: 'I don't really want to stand next to you; you are too pretty. Can you just stand over there?'" However, the Olympian said the model was "nice" about it.</p><p>"She is really nice," Vonn said of Bündchen. "I've met her a few times before, and she is just really down to earth."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vonn even praised Bündchen for being a role model. "Gisele is a model but she also has kids and works out. She is just in general a strong person," said the former. "The campaign is more about the strong will of women and that comes in many different shapes and sizes." At that time, Vonn was already dating Woods while Bündchen was five years into her marriage to Brady.</p><p>Lindsey Vonn and Tiger Woods dated from 2013 to 2015.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/mixcollage-12-feb-2024-11-11-am-8173.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tom Brady's $375 Million Fox Deal In 2024 Predicts He'll Be An Announcer For The 2025 Super Bowl</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The quarterback took a year off in 2023, but will join the Fox booth in 2024.

In April 2019, the former roasted himself on Twitter to congratulate the latter on his 15th major victory at the Masters Tournament that year. "Running the numbers on how long it'll take me to get to 15…" the footballer wrote alongside that famous Zach Galifianakis calculating meme. "Congrats Tiger! What a performance.."</p><p>In 2020, the athletes played charity golf against each other at "The Match: Champions for Charity." Paired with Peyton Manning, Woods competed with Brady and Phil Mickelson. They raised $20 million meant to support coronavirus relief efforts. The following year, Woods attended Super Bowl LV to watch Brady win after just joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in early 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The divorced sports stars' relationship has strictly been related to business, at least based on public sightings.
