In the first film of the franchise, Scream, the killers were revealed to be Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) boyfriend, Billy Loomis, and their mutual friend, Stu Macher (Matthew Lilliard).</p><p>Ulrich recalled that before shooting, he didn't realize there was supposed to be humor in the story, which led him to think some of his-co-stars were ruining the film. "I think part of it was the mindset of Billy and me getting into that mindset."</p><p>During another interview the Jericho actor remembered, "I saw it as this very serious documentary about two killers in high school and I was researching serial killers and the psychology of them, so I didn't really key into the humor of the story until take one of day one."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that the cast had fun together. "That movie was so close to not even happening, and we were in Napa Valley feeling like some independent film. We shot, I think, five weeks of nights to start. It was so much fun and yet so dark at the same time, both literally and figuratively."</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-skeet-ulrich>What Happened To Skeet Ulrich?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/skeet-ulrich.jpg><p>When Skeet Ulrich appeared in Scream, it looked like he was on his way to the top. Ulrich had also appeared with his Scream co-star, Neve Campbell, in The Craft, and can also be seen in the Oscar-winning film, As Good As It Gets, but several of his scenes were cut from the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his next few films were flops, and soon, he wasn't as in-demand as he had been. Although Ulrich seemed to nearly disappear from the industry after the late nineties, he was still working.</p><p>He had roles on Law and Order: LA and Jericho, and also worked on several TV movies, including Gimme Shelter and I am Elizabeth Smart. Ulrich discussed what he's been up to since 1996's Scream with the A.V. Club.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussing his career when he took on 2003's Miracles</a>, Ulrich said, "I was sort of falling by the wayside a little bit in film. My kids had been born - my twins - and I'd taken a year off, and I'd done a couple of movies I probably shouldn't have done, in a career sense."</p><p>"Miracles was my first stint in TV. But when I read that pilot script, I was just blown away and had to be a part of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ulrich also spoke about how the cast members of Jericho developed real friendships on the set. "That became a real family, that group of people, and I think it was felt from an audience perspective." About 2017's Austin Found, he said "I just fell in love with the story. I think it has such an interesting take on today's culture, our obsession with fame, and how it can overshadow parenting."</p><p>The actor stayed busy, and was eventually cast on Netflix's hit show, Riverdale. "I love that group," Ulrich said.</p><p>Recently, the actor has returned to the Scream franchise, and appeared in Scream 5 and Scream 6.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jenna-Ortega-in-Scream-via-Slash-Film.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did The New Scream Movies Nearly Leave Out The Franchise's Most Important Person?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Everyone knows that Neve Campbell won't return for Scream 6, but another franchise legend may have been briefly overlooked for Scream 5.</span><p>Ulrich said he feels the original film's director, Wes Craven would be proud. "It's amazing, you know, I couldn't help but think of Wes [Craven] riding in and how happy he would be of the group that's telling these stories now and that the fervor for this franchise still exists."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ulrich added he stood behind Neve Campbell's decision to leave the franchise, and revealed the two had hung out. "We were together over the weekend at a convention. She loves it; she loves what we've done. There were just business things as a businesswoman that are important to her and we all stand behind her."</p><h2 id=what-has-ulrich-said-about-working-on-the-film-scream>What Has Ulrich Said About Working On The Film, Scream?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/scream-movie-poster.jpg><p>Some <a href=#>fans have described Scream as a perfect horror movie</a>. What has Skeet Ulrich, one of the original Ghostface killers, said about making the film?</p><p>During one interview, Ulrich revealed his favorite line from his Scream partner-in-crime, was one Matthew Lilliard had ad-libbed after having a phone thrown at him (also un-scripted). Ulrich accidentally hit his co-star with a phone, and Lilliard, (as Stu) says, "You hit me with the phone, you d***!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Discussing the moment, the actor recalled, "It wasn't scripted that he gets hit by a phone, it wasn't scripted that he has a reaction to it."</p><p>He continued, "I was venting at having lost Sidney at that moment or knowing where she was, and the fake blood was so sticky that when I went to throw the phone just in frustration, it didn't go in the direction I intended and what you see - it hit him and his reaction was in the moment."</p><p>Ulrich even created two rooms for himself during shooting: one for himself, and one for his character. During an interview with The A.V. Club, Ulrich revealed, "the hotel suite they gave me had two rooms, so I used one just to sleep, and the other one... I turned the other room into Billy's room."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Original 'Scream' Cast, Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It's been over 15 years since the original 'Scream' film, and many of the main cast, including David Arquette, have earned a huge net worth.</span><p>"And I'd sit in there and just read about John Wayne Gacy and play the most satanic music I could find and just try and find him (Billy) rather quickly in that environment.
