During his comeback promo, <a href=#>Punk called out Darby Allin for his first match back,</a> which was a major thing to happen for a young star like Allin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the match was mostly about Punk, Allin was given a lot of offense in their match at the All Out 2021 PPV event, and he did a great job of helping the veteran shake off any ring rust he was experiencing.</p><h2 id=worst-injured-at-double-or-nothing><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Worst: Injured At Double Or Nothing</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Darby-Allin-Double-or-Nothing-2020.jpg><p>Darby Allin’s ascent up the AEW card was going well by the time Double or Nothing 2020 came around, <a href=#>though there has always been some fear when it comes to his body</a>, especially with the types of stunts and bumps he performs.</p><p>During the Casino Ladder Match, Allin suffered an injury after jumping off a ladder on his skateboard, through an opponent and another ladder. It was a scary spot and it saw him miss two months of action in AEW.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-dream-match-vs-jeff-hardy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Best: Dream Match Vs Jeff Hardy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Darby-Allin-Jumping-from-a-Ladder-AEW.jpg><p>When looking at how Jeff Hardy’s time in AEW has gone down, with him getting suspended following an arrest, it was a good idea for AEW to book a dream match between Darby Allin and Jeff Hardy as early as they did.</p><p>The two have been compared a lot, and they lived up to the lofty expectations <a href=#>with their spot-filled clash on an episode of Dynamite.</a> It wasn’t a match of the year candidate, but given Hardy’s age it was as good as anyone could’ve hoped for.</p><h2 id=worst-weird-feud-with-andrade-el-idolo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Worst: Weird Feud With Andrade El Idolo</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Darby-Allin-and-Andrade.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>In the last year and more, Darby Allin has felt a little lost on AEW’s roster,</a> with him being shoe-horned unnaturally into feuds with lackluster build. One of those was a rivalry with Andrade El Idolo, which started when Andrade thought Allin was a child.</p><p>This was a bizarre and poor way to kick-start a feud between two tremendous performers, and it led to their feud being simply average, with Andrade attempting to employ Allin at times too. It just didn’t work and is among Allin’s most boring feuds.</p><h2 id=best-debut-vs-cody-rhodes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Best: Debut Vs Cody Rhodes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Darby-Allin-vs-Cody-AEW-Fyter-Fest.jpg><p>Darby Allin made his debut on AEW’s second ever show - Fyter Fest. With him being mostly unknown to the wider wrestling audience, AEW did a great job of introducing his unique persona and character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Best Moments Of CM Punk’s AEW Career (& 5 Worst)</a></span></p><p>His first match was against Cody Rhodes and it stole the show, with Allin being made to look like Rhodes’ equal. Allin proved to be an instant success, with him being allowed the time to showcase his talents on his first night in the promotion.</p><h2 id=worst-losing-early-to-jimmy-havoc><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Worst: Losing Early To Jimmy Havoc</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Darby-Allin-Cracker-Barrel-bump.jpg><p>After his draw against Cody Rhodes, Allin should have been booked quite strongly from there, taking advantage of the hype around his debut. AEW decided to have him lose in a six-man tag on the next show, though it was understandable given his opponents included MJF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his loss in his next match was inexcusable. Allin was on the losing end of a triple threat Cracker Barrel match with Jimmy Havoc coming out on top. Havoc clearly wasn’t in AEW’s major plans, so to have him win made no sense at all.</p><h2 id=best-sting-rsquo-s-debut><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Best: Sting’s Debut</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AEW-Sting-Debut-Darby-Allin-Cody.jpg><p>Although Sting’s AEW debut was more about the legend himself, Darby Allin was made to look like a huge deal. Sting came to the aid of a group of babyfaces, before staring down those that were left in the ring. He walked past Arn Anderson, Dustin Rhodes, and Cody Rhodes, before reaching Allin.</p><p>Sting and Allin’s face-off was the most significant of the segment, with Sting lingering on the younger star for the longest time. That alone made this segment about Allin too, and his involvement here will ensure that he remains a significant part of Sting’s history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worst-speaking-out><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Worst: Speaking Out</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/darby-allin-looking-wild-aew.jpg><p>During the pandemic, many brave individuals spoke up against alleged abusers within the professional wrestling industry in the Speaking Out Movement. One of the names mentioned was Darby Allin, which threw his name into some bad press.</p><p>It didn’t affect his position as such in AEW, but when looking online there are some in AEW comments sections which don’t forget the fact that his name was brought up. <a href=#>He would also get called out on Twitter by Cora Jade</a> in an interaction which made him delete a tweet.</p><h2 id=best-winning-tnt-championship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Best: Winning TNT Championship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Darby-Allin-TNT-Championship-AEW.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After multiple attempts, Darby Allin finally overcame Cody Rhodes at the Full Gear 2020 PPV, <a href=#>with him winning the TNT Championship in what is still arguably his best moment in the company</a>.

It dragged, it was repetitive, and it did Allin no favors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeRmsRusMCrmbJlkaG5qrqMm5ysrF2svLO%2F02akqKWVo8G0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-best-moments-of-darby-allin-s-aew-career-5-worst.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./almost-unbelievable-here-s-how-eva-longoria-paved-her-way-to-the-top.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./almost-unbelievable-here-s-how-eva-longoria-paved-her-way-to-the-top.html>Almost UnbeliEVAble: Here's How Eva Longoria Paved Her Way To The Top</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./20-photos-of-the-girls-from-below-deck.html>20 Photos Of The Girls From Below Deck</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./20-photos-of-the-girls-from-below-deck.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
