At the time, he was 23 years old. The OG <strong>Playboy</strong> was never again single. The infamous <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class=hgKElc>Playboy Mansion was filled with women much younger than him. Today, <a href=#>the once glamorous villa is abandoned and falling apart</a>.</span></span></p><h2 id=wife-1-mildred-williams><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Wife #1: Mildred Williams</span></h2><p>Hefner was married to Mildred Williams for ten years, but it wasn't his longest marriage. They met at the Northwestern University in Illinois and tied the knot soon after. According to Hefner's interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Williams had cheated on him before they got married, which devastated him. "I had literally saved myself for my wife, but after we had sex she told me that she'd had an affair. That was the most devastating moment in my life," he said. <a href=#>The cheating scandal </a>might explain why he did a complete 180 in his attitude towards romantic relationships. They got a divorce in 1959.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barbara-lynn-klein><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Barbara Lynn Klein</span></h2><p>For the next decade, Hugh Hefner kept a low profile as far as his dating life went. In 1969, he started dating Barbara Lynn Klein, the first of many Playmates.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Reunion: 10 Surprising Things We've Learned" href=#>'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Reunion: 10 Surprising Things We've Learned</a></span></p><p>They were together until 1976. During that time, Hefner convinced the twenty-something year old that she should change her name to Barbi Benton - and she did. Back then, <a href=#>working at the Playboy Mansion was said to be a good enough gig</a>. Being a Playboy Bunny was a lucrative job.</p><h2 id=shannon-tweed><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Shannon Tweed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=slide-title-text>Shannon Lee Tweed Simmons is a Canadian actor that was at the forefront of making erotic thrillers. In 1982, she was named the Playmate of the Year and dated Hugh Hefner for two years. When they broke up, they fought over the custody of the dog they had together. At the time, she was about 25 years old. While living at the Mansion, she met her future husband, Gene Simmons, AKA the Demon from KISS. They remain married to this day.</p><h2 id=carrie-leigh><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Carrie Leigh</span></h2><p>While Shannon Tweed has nothing bad to say about her Bunny years, Carrie Leigh is among the more critical voices. "When you live in an environment like that that's so different from how other people live, you start forgetting who you are and what you believe is right," she told the Washington Post in 1999, likening the house to a cult. She sued Hefner three times and lived with him from 1983 to 1988.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wife-2-kimberley-conrad><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Wife #2: Kimberley Conrad</span></h2><p>Hugh Hefner didn't stay single for too long. A year later, in 1989, he married Kimberley Conrad and stayed married with her until 2010. However, they had separated years before and lived close by.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Betty White & 9 Other Living Celebs Who Are 90+" href=#>Betty White & 9 Other Living Celebs Who Are 90+</a></span></p><p>She was 26 when they tied the knot, while he was over 60 years old already.

After he separated with his second wife, he dated several other Bunnies, including Brande Roderick. In 2000, she was named the Playmate of the Year - we're sensing a pattern here - but she left the mansion because she wasn't done with her acting career just yet. That's when they split up. After all, Hefner didn't date outside of his personal Shangri-la.</p><h2 id=tina-marie-jordan><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tina Marie Jordan</span></h2><p>Tina Marie Jordan is just one of the several women that Hugh Hefner was dating in the early 2000s. He wasn't a monogamous man and made no attempts to hide it. He dated seven women at the same time! Whoever was the Playmate of the Year was typically considered his #1. The inner workings of such an arrangement remain unknown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=izabella-st-james><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Izabella St. James</span></h2><p>Izabella St. James moved into the mansion in 2002 when she was 27 years old and stayed there for two years. She was one of the seven already-mentioned women that Hefner dated at the same time. In 2006, she <a href=#>published a revealing expose</a> that painted a grim picture of what went on behind the walls of the Playboy Mansion. Being one of Hef's girlfriends meant she got her own room, a $1000 weekly allowance, and infinite money to spend on plastic surgery.</p><p>"The carpet in the upstairs hallway also had not been changed in who knows how long. Everything was just old and stale. Archie the house dog would regularly relieve himself on the hallway curtains, adding the scent of urine to the general scent of decay," she famously wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holly-madison-bridget-marquardt-and-kendra-wilkinson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson</span></h2><p class=slide-title-text>Among the many women Hugh Hefner dated in the last decade of his life are also Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson. They were the stars of <a href=#>The Girls Next Door</a>, a reality show that ran for six seasons. In the show's sixth season, the trio was replaced by two identical twins, Karissa and Kristina Shannon.</p><h2 id=karissa-and-kristina-shannon><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Karissa and Kristina Shannon</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Hugh Hefner dated two 20 year-old identical twins, Kristina and Karissa. Eventually, they left the Playboy Mansion and joined the <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a> house. Their lives are rather tragic: they had several botched plastic surgeries and they were both arrested for violence. Today, they are 31 years old.</p><h2 id=wife-3-crystal-harris><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wife 3: Crystal Harris</span></h2><p>In December 2010, Hugh Hefner got engaged to the 24 year-old Crystal Harris who eventually became his last wife. After he died in 2017, <a href=#>she got a $5 million house that he had bought for her</a>, while the rest of his fortune went to his children and charities. She hasn't distanced herself from Hef like some his other ex-girlfriends did.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a class=bc-title-link title="Here's How Much Money JWOWW Turned Down From Hugh Hefner" href=#>Here's How Much Money JWOWW Turned Down From Hugh Hefner</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WlpbGiwMRmpqdlmKq0qXnHnp2nnaKoeqbEjLCgr52jYq6vsIygoKuklqe2prrDrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fan-update-on-hugh-hefner-s-ex-wives-and-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrity-engagements-of-2020-celebrities-who-got-engaged-this-year.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrity-engagements-of-2020-celebrities-who-got-engaged-this-year.html>Celebrity Engagements of 2020, Celebrities Who Got Engaged This Year</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./17-steamy-pics-of-emilia-clarke-vs-sophie-turner.html>17 Steamy Pics Of Emilia Clarke Vs Sophie Turner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./17-steamy-pics-of-emilia-clarke-vs-sophie-turner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
