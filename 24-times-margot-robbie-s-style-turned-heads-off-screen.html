She is a brilliant actress with classic features and plenty of style. Anyone who has enjoyed watching Margot in The&nbsp;Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad and I, Tonya&nbsp;will appreciate this look at twenty of her hottest fashion and beauty moments.</p><p>Margot doesn't disappoint on the red carpet and also has serious street style. Whether she's dressed up or down, she radiates glamour. One really nice thing about this Aussie actress is her smile. It's her best accessory and Margot smiles a lot. She's not one of those angsty actresses, although she expresses darker emotions perfectly onscreen.</p><p>Born on the 2nd of July, 1990, Margot is currently&nbsp;filming Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, alongside her former The Wolf of Wall Street cast mate, Leonardo DiCaprio. She's playing Sharon Tate, who was a victim of the cruel and sadistic Manson gang. This film is being directed by Quentin Tarantino. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has an epic cast, including Brad Pitt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robbie shines in every role. She's so natural as an actress and the camera loves her. Since she's so photogenic, let's take a look at some of her very best looks.</p><h2 id=sapphires-and-red-orange-lipstick-at-the-2016-oscars>Sapphires and Red-Orange Lipstick at the 2016 Oscars</h2><p>Margot oozes Old Hollywood glamour here. Her red-orange lipstick is the perfect complement to her fair skin, blond hair, and black dress. Margot wanted a special makeup look for Oscar night 2016, so her makeup artist applied Hourglass Opaque Rouge Liquid Lipstick, according to <a href=#>Elle.com</a>. If you want the same shade of Hourglass lipstick, choose Raven. It's a bold color that may require a little (or maybe a lot) of self-confidence.&nbsp; Robbie's dress for this very special event was created by Tom Ford and her jewelry was from Forevermark.</p><h2 id=decked-out-in-dior-at-the-2015-dior-cruise-fashion-show>Decked Out in Dior at the 2015 Dior Cruise Fashion Show</h2><p>Margot dressed in a green Dior top and gold skirt when she was a VIP guest at the 2015 Dior Cruise collection fashion show, according to <a href=#>Vogue.com</a>. Lots of famous ladies showed up to see Dior's resort looks, including Marion Cotillard and Rihanna. Margot is a Dior fan. She's been photographed in Dior designs many times. These clothes are all about French glam and they give Margot the high-end, runway-ready look. She's worn so many fun Dior pieces, from sparkly mini-dresses to neutral jumpsuits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wearing-brock-collection-at-a-movie-premiere>Wearing Brock Collection at a Movie Premiere</h2><p>Here, Margot goes ginger and sets off her temporarily-red hair with a fresh and pretty, blue-and-white dress from Brock Collection. Brock Collection is another fashion brand that Margot has worn more than once! Clothes from Brock Collection always have an ultra-feminine vibe. Margot went red in 2014, according to <a href=#>Glamour.com</a>. Margot has dyed her hair really dark for parts and then decided to go back to blond. Going red is often a step in between. Lightening hair gradually makes it easier to avoid serious hair damage.</p><h2 id=sleek-and-sophisticated-in-calvin-klein>Sleek and Sophisticated in Calvin Klein</h2><p>This outfit is amazing. The look puts all of the focus on Margot's face. Calvin Klein clothes are ultra-modern and they are the type of well-tailored clothes that look good on pretty much anyone. Margot wore this outfit in 2016, according to the <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a> website. The mustard tone of the long jacket is unusual. It's a bit edgier than beige or camel. She pairs the look with pointed high heels, a simple white turtleneck, and natural hair and makeup. Margot&nbsp;wore this outfit to a Calvin Klein fashion show. She likes to make the scene during Fashion Week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bold-and-confident-in-orange-leather>Bold and Confident in Orange Leather</h2><p>Would you have the courage to wear a bright-orange leather dress? Margot did and it suited the occasion perfectly. According to the Dailytelegraph.co.au website, Margot chose this daring outfit while working as a sustainability and electric car ambassador for Nissan. Since she was posing with sleek and shiny cars, she was smart to put on something colorful that helped her to stand out. Margot wears a lot of different colors. She doesn't stick with warm colors or cool colors. She seems to look good in everything.</p><h2 id=radiant-in-a-pale-blue-dress>Radiant In a Pale Blue Dress</h2><p>Blue is usually a good color for blonds and Margot does look amazing in this shade. This cute Gucci dress has a casual vibe, despite the high collar, and she wears it with flats to keep the look relaxed. This pale blue dress is perfect for a sunny day out. Margot wore this dress while promoting her film, Peter Rabbit. Margot wears a half-up, half-down hairstyle here, which is really flattering. According to <a href=#>Popsugar.com.au</a>, Margot visits hairstylist-to-the-stars, Matt Rez, to keep her hair looking great. Rez uses Kerastase products to keep Robbie's hair silky and soft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-chic-in-a-dress-over-a-tank-top>So Chic in a Dress Over a Tank Top</h2><p>This is the type of outfit that most fashionistas wouldn't mind having in their closets. It's a youthful look with a touch of layering that makes it more interesting. Robbie pairs a simple white tank top with a red-and-black sundress. The tank top underneath makes the whole look a bit edgier. Heavy black boots with embellishments add some rock-n-roll attitude. This look has a bit of a Gwen Stefani vibe. According to Marieclaire.co.uk, Robbie relies on Laura Mercier makeup. She's going for a deeper-than-average lip color here and that works with the dress.</p><h2 id=looking-powerful-in-scarlet-versace>Looking Powerful in Scarlet Versace</h2><p>Margot took power dressing to a whole new level when she put on a Versace skirt suit. According to Vogue.co.uk, Margot was hopping on a hot 2018 trend known as "corporate chic". This red suit is part of a collection that Versace head designer, Donatella Versace, created in order to pay homage to her late brother, Gianni. Gianni was the head designer for his namesake brand, before Andrew Cunanan took his life. Margot looks great in this outfit. She wears the suit - it doesn't wear her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stylish-in-an-offbeat-evening-gown>Stylish In an Offbeat Evening Gown</h2><p>This dress is pretty unusual. It's a unique mixture of bold black and dusty-toned floral fabrics. It's a dress that might be described as "hard to wear" because it has a lot of offbeat details. When an Elle.com reporter wrote about Margot and this dress, its designer wasn't mentioned...so, where it came from is a bit of a mystery. Margot usually wears big designers, or indie Aussie designers, on the red carpet. Maybe this is one of the indie designs.</p><h2 id=margot-dazzles-in-black-and-white>Margot Dazzles in Black and White</h2><p>Black and white outfits always offer graphic appeal. Margot went for high contrast when she put on this glamorous jumpsuit and long coat. According to Marieclaire.com.au, Robbie is a celebrity who "kills it" on the red carpet. Part of her personal style is about changing it up. She doesn't stick with the same silhouette every time. She plays around with fashion. It's cool that she chose pants for this red carpet event, because we've all seen a million sparkly dresses on&nbsp;female celebs already.</p><h2 id=all-bundled-up-in-cute-faux-fur>All Bundled Up in Cute Faux Fur</h2><p>Talking about fashion is fun and fashion isn't necessarily so frivolous. We all have to get dressed in the morning. We might as well put on something that we like. Margot bundled up in this fake fur on a chilly day, as onlookers gawked. As usual, she looked friendly. Margot is more than a pretty face. Margot is able to laugh at herself. According to Stuff.co.nz, Jimmy Kimmel forced Margot to look at a humiliating photo from her childhood while she was on his show. In the pic, Margot&nbsp;was an awkward adolescent, but totally cute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=casual-in-jeans-and-mules>Casual in Jeans and Mules</h2><p>Sometimes, simple clothes show off natural beauty more than fussier designs, although wild couture has its place. When Margot tones it down in jeans and a button-down shirt, she looks comfortable, chic and low-key. She adds mules that lengthen the look of her legs and add a bit of retro appeal. According to Fashiongum.com, mules are back in style for summer 2018. I'm not sure when Margot wore this outfit, but it's definitely a hot look right now, because of the shoes.</p><h2 id=edgy-in-her-suicide-squad-costume>Edgy in Her Suicide Squad Costume</h2><p>Everyone loved Margot's Harley Quinn outfit from Suicide Squad. While the movie didn't get the critical acclaim that its producers, director, and cast hoped for, no one will ever forget Margot's Harley Quinn look. Also, she was great in a not-so-great movie. According to Variety.com,&nbsp;Yolandi Visser from rap-rave music group, Die Antwoord, believes that Harley's look was ripped off from her band. Yolandi doesn't blame Margot Robbie - she blames the film's director. Margot went all out in the role and her costume surely helped her to get into character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sleek-in-a-chain-mail-dress>Sleek in a Chain Mail Dress</h2><p>According to Ca.hellomagazine.com, both Kendall Jenner and Margot Robbie are fans of trendy chain mail dresses. These styles are perfect for nightclubs, because their metallic glimmer makes them glamorous. Also, chain mail is a strong look which is perfect for strong and confident women. This simple sheath is all about the fabric. It has interesting cutouts at the shoulders which make it a bit daring. This short dress was paired with gold high heels, so it elongates the look of Margot's legs.</p><h2 id=feminine-in-a-halter-strap-dress>Feminine in a Halter Strap Dress</h2><p>Halter-style gowns look very elegant. Margot looks great in this black version. Gowns of this type are also a favorite of fashion models, such as VS Angel, Lily Aldridge. Halter-style gowns show off the shoulders and arms, without being too revealing. Black provides a lot of contrast with Margot's fair coloring, so it's a good color choice for her. She pairs the look with fashion-forward black and white high heels. According to Whowhatwear.com, Margot likes to wear fancy shoes for special events, but considers classic Pumas the best choices for off-duty days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-rocks-menswear-inspired-pieces>She Rocks Menswear-inspired Pieces</h2><p>There's something about a gorgeous woman in a menswear-inspired suit. Marlene Dietrich used to wear pantsuits and her menswear-style designs gave her so much attitude. Madonna considers Dietrich a style icon, according to the Dailystar.co.uk website. Madonna has worn a lot of outfits with Dietrichesque elements. Maybe Margot Robbie os going for the same "golden age of Hollywood" look. This jacket is actually a short dress. It doesn't need much in the way of accessories, because the shape stands out.</p><h2 id=looking-cool-in-printed-gucci>Looking Cool in Printed Gucci</h2><p>Gucci is such a hot brand right now. This Italian fashion house has had new life breathed into it by its latest head designer, Alessandro Michele. Gucci is worn in Hollywood and it's also a favorite of hip-hop stars and pro athletes. You'll see it on a diverse range of fashion-conscious people, including Dakota Johnson and Rihanna, according to Ranker.com. Gucci has a bohemian vibe. It's "rich hippie" stuff. This dress looks great on Margot. It's hip, colorful and its bow tie makes it special. Like most of Margot's clothes, this is not a budget design.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=edgy-and-striking-in-metallics>Edgy and Striking in Metallics</h2><p>For the premiere of Suicide Squad in 2015, Margot Robbie went for an inventive dress from the Alexander McQueen fashion house, according to Vogue.com. The dress was partially covered in sequins, to form the shape of a glittering unicorn. This dress has big-time drama and Margot was smart to choose a bright lipstick to accent the gown's full-on glamour. Natural makeup would not work so well here. Plus, Harley Quinn's not much for natural makeup, either. Margot's plum lip color and groomed brows are just right for this wild high-fashion evening dress.</p><h2 id=margot-s-street-style-is-fabulous>Margot’s Street Style is Fabulous</h2><p>Red really brightens up Margot's fair skin. It's a good color for her and this street style look is seriously fashionable. According to the Dailymail.co.uk website, this sweater is an Alexander McQueen design. It's embellished with a bunch of embroideries that looks like brooches. Under the sweater, she wore a striped shirt and leather-look pants. She finished the look with fancy loafers. These clothes are wearable, but really glamorous. Margot's hair and makeup are also perfect here. Maybe she was headed somewhere special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=margot-rocked-this-punk-inspired-look>Margot Rocked this Punk-inspired Look</h2><p>These red trousers come from I.AM.GIA, according to Thezoereport.com. Margot wears the tight pants (which have a lot of punk edge) with a black top and sunglasses from Quay. While the zips and fabric give these pants punk attitude, their cut is very Mod. Margot styles the pants with black ankle boots and a black handbag. Bright pants aren't something that everyone can pull off...or wants to wear at all. They do look good on Margot.&nbsp; This is an actress with a very impressive wardrobe of eclectic pieces.</p><h2 id=sneakers-and-a-dress-look-modern>Sneakers and a Dress Look Modern</h2><p>When Margot dresses down, she does it in style. This outfit is cute and looks comfortable, too. She adds clean white sneakers to a shorter cotton dress to get a fresh and casual look. Her high ponytail and light makeup fit the breezy vibe of this outfit. Margot is a fashionista, but she's actually a really private person. Her marriage is something that she mostly keeps to herself. According to the Dailymail.co.uk website, Margot's hubby is Tom Ackerly and he's a director from England.</p><h2 id=stylish-in-a-fun-printed-coat>Stylish in a Fun Printed Coat</h2><p>Margot must have turned a lot of heads in this outfit. She looks very "uptown" in this checked dress/animal print combo. The shoes are also awesome. The soft grey tones of the coat look really good on Margot. The color isn't too harsh. It's really flattering. According to the Dailymail.co.uk website, Robbie donned this beautiful outfit for the premiere of The Word of Wall Street. She's been seen in this ensemble more than once, with different shoes. Who wouldn't wear this twice?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=basic-black-suits-margot>Basic Black Suits Margot</h2><p>It's nice to see what female celebs choose to put on when they aren't doing press junkets and appearing on red carpets. This outfit doesn't have a designer signature. It's more about Margot's personal style. Leggings and chunky boots look comfortable and the black coat and bandanna have a sporty, adventurous vibe. According to Foxsports.com, Margot is into sports, especially football (soccer in America). She also ice skated for five hours a day to portray Tonya Harding in I, Tonya.</p><h2 id=margot-looks-so-different-with-dark-hair>Margot Looks So Different With Dark Hair</h2><p>With dark hair, Margot sort of resembles Emma Stone (when Emma has dark hair). Actresses play around with hair color a lot. It takes some time to adjust to seeing Margot without the blond mane, but she looks great both ways. Her neutral trench (find your own at Burberry.com), striped top and boot-cut jeans look really European. This is high-style casual wear. Margot can afford the very best, because she works so hard. Good clothes are a perk of being on the Hollywood A-list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Elle.com, Vogue.com, Glamour.com,&nbsp;Dailymail.co.uk,&nbsp;Popsugar.com.au,&nbsp;Marieclaire.co.uk,&nbsp;Vogue.co.uk,&nbsp;Variety.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYml6tbXMnqpmpZGntLDAjKumm5qZmnq0wNilnGaspae7prCMoZyanKNivKeyjKyaq52Vo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f24-times-margot-robbie-s-style-turned-heads-off-screen.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./barbara-fairchild-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./barbara-fairchild-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Barbara Fairchild Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-candace-mcduffie-the-root-writer-slammed-for-saying-chris-rock-deserved-to-be-slapped-at-the.html>Who is Candace McDuffie?
