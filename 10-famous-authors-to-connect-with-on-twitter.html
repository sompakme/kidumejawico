Actors, pop stars, politicians… all kinds of noteworthy celebrities and artists converge on the social media platform. It is a popular marketing venue, so what better place for celebrities to promote themselves, right? Unfortunately for most Twitter users, the sense of familiarity one might get from “following” their favorite celeb is false. While some celebrities hold the occasional question and answer session over Twitter with fans, for the most part, it’s difficult for the average Twitter user to catch the attention of their favorite star.</p><p>That is, with the notable exception of one famous group of people: authors. A lot of bestselling and award-winning authors seem to be right at home on Twitter and regularly network with fans and answer questions. It makes sense, after all, that even the most famous authors could enjoy regularly interacting with people through a social media platform that emphasizes the importance of the written word. Or 140 characters, to be exact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So the next time you finish that page-turning bestseller and wish you could share your reactions, excitement, and – shall we say, <i>passionate</i> - criticism with the author, maybe you can! Here are some of Twitter’s most active famous authors who regularly interact with and reply to fans (and might even throw in a few bonus excerpts from or details about an upcoming book for their faithful followers).</p><h2 id=10-john-green-realjohngreen><strong>10. John Green&nbsp;@realjohngreen</strong></h2><p>Award winning young adult author John Green has a tremendous social media following, with over 2.14 million followers on Twitter. Author of “Looking for Alaska” and the #1 bestselling (and soon-to-be-movie starring Shailene Woodley) “The Fault in Our Stars,” Green interacts regularly with his fans on not just Twitter but Tumblr and YouTube as well. Green frequently releases video blogs and is behind an educational Youtube video series called “Crash Course” that he distributes to audiences on social media.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-judy-blume-judyblume><strong>9. Judy Blume&nbsp;@judyblume</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iconic children’s author Judy Blume has sold more than 80 million books worldwide during her successful career. The author of “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” has written numerous books that were among the first children’s and young adult works to tackle difficult and controversial issues. But her notoriety has clearly not made her detached from fans: she regularly answers questions on Twitter. Using Twitter a bit like her own personal journal or diary, she also shares photos and news that are sometimes whimsical and often insightful, just like the books she writes. Blume has over 100,000 followers.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-margaret-atwood-margaretatwood><strong>8. Margaret Atwood @MargaretAtwood</strong></h2><p>According to the Twitter profile of Margaret Atwood, being on Twitter is like “having fairies in your garden.” The Nobel award winning Canadian author of dozens of bestselling books including “The Handmaid’s Tale” indeed makes time for Twitter, sharing news, updates and of course answering questions sent in from fans. She even tweeted candid photos of herself celebrating the news that she’d won the Nobel Prize. Her regular activity on Twitter has helped her gather over 440,000 followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-diana-gabaldon-writer-dg><strong>7. Diana Gabaldon&nbsp;@Writer_DG</strong></h2><p>The author behind the bestselling (soon to be a television series) “Outlander” is known for writing long, detailed, romantic and complex storylines, and Twitter seems to be yet another outlet for all of the words she has to share with the world. She keeps a close eye on the social media platform for questions and fan reactions to her stories, and is usually very willing to answer just about any question about her work. She also regularly shares news and updates on her progress with forthcoming novels with her 46,000 followers.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-maureen-johnson-maureenjohnson><strong>6. Maureen Johnson&nbsp;@MaureenJohnson</strong></h2><p>Reading through young adult author Maureen Johnson’s Twitter account is a little like watching one of the author’s stories unfold in real time, as she often Tweets about her own daily escapades in such a captivating and fanciful voice that they start to resemble one of her works of fiction. Aside from constantly interacting with her 99,000 followers, the author of “13 Little Blue Envelopes” also tweets about news of interest to other authors and gives advice to emerging writers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-maggie-stiefvater-mstiefvater><strong>5. Maggie Stiefvater&nbsp;@mstiefvater</strong></h2><p>Popular young adult author Maggie Stiefvater, known for her series of bestselling books about werewolves and faeries, shares details about her daily life with fans on Twitter. Stiefvater interacts with 42,000 of her fans on the social media platform by answering questions and encouraging those who tweet her asking for advice about becoming an author.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-jane-espenson-janeespenson><strong>4. Jane Espenson&nbsp;@JaneEspenson</strong></h2><p>Award-winning television screenwriter Jane Espenson might be known more by her work than by her name (she’s a writer behind numerous iconic episodes for shows including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Game of Thrones, Torchwood, and Once Upon a Time). Despite her undoubtedly hectic schedule writing new screenplays, she regularly makes time for fan questions about the television shows on Twitter. She also fosters a sense of community through her Twitter account by regularly encouraging her followers to drop everything and do nothing but write along with her for an hour. Espenson has over 99,000 followers on Twitter.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-stephen-king-stephenking><strong>3. Stephen King&nbsp;@StephenKing</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A relative newcomer to Twitter, the legendary author <a title="Stephen King Net Worth" href=#>Stephen King</a> seems to be slowly warming up to the platform. He has sold over 350 million copies of books worldwide, but now he is venturing into the realm of answering questions from fans about his work. Since he joined Twitter a few months ago, he has amassed over 300,000 followers and has Tweeted some news and updates about his work.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-chris-colfer-chriscolfer><strong>2. Chris Colfer&nbsp;@Chriscolfer</strong></h2><p>Bestselling children’s author <a title="Chris Colfer Net Worth" href=#>Chris Colfer</a> spends a lot of time tweeting about his beloved book series, “The Land of Stories” and provides many sneak peeks and artwork from the #1 New York Times bestselling series to his followers. Colfer has over 2 million followers, mainly because of the fact that he is also an actor, but he seems to prioritize answering questions from readers and sharing news about his book series.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-philip-pullman-philippullman><strong>1. Philip Pullman&nbsp;@PhilipPullman</strong></h2><p>The English novelist of the bestselling and award-winning “His Dark Materials” young adult series (which was turned into “The Golden Compass” movie), spends time answering questions with thousands of his fans on Twitter.
