She doesn’t share your secrets on her MySpace page.” It appears that several famous BFFs don’t follow these rules.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout history, there have been numerous memorable BFFs turned enemies, such as Superman & Batman, Brenda Walsh & Kelly Taylor, and <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a> & <a href=#>“Macho Man” Randy Savage</a>. Famous besties are probably the only parings in the world that can gain more attention than a celebrity couple. BFF celebrity duos have the world buzzing with their intense partying lifestyle, spending every waking moment together and throwing shade at other celebs. They appear together on the covers of every tabloid magazine, usually get a special duo name, and might even get their own reality TV series. They’re living on cloud nine and have the world at their fingertips. They get to rule the world and the best part of it all is that they get to do it with their best friend forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, sometimes, the honeymoon can come to an epic-crashing end. Several world famous celeb BFFs went from being inseparable to becoming hated rivals. The once best friends now spend their time insulting each other in interviews and online. Often, famous duos will suddenly just stop being friends and give no real explanation. Some celeb BFFs were really good friends but they make much better enemies. Here is a look at 15 Famous BFFs That Became Bitter Enemies.</p><h2 id=heather-locklear-amp-denise-richards><strong>Heather Locklear & Denise Richards</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Denise Richards</a> and <a href=#>Heather Locklear</a> were once the closest of BFFs. These two gorgeous besties had everyone talking when they’d light up the town. However, they really got people talking when they suddenly stopped being friends. In 1994, Locklear married Bon Jovi guitarist <a href=#>Richie Sambora</a>. In 2006, she filed for divorce, which was finalized in 2007. Three months after separating, Sambora started dating Richards. By that point, Locklear and Richards were no longer friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with Redbook magazine, Denise Richards spoke out for the first time about the falling out. She wouldn’t elaborate on the cause of the rift but noted that they weren’t on speaking terms long before Richards began dating Sambora. She also said, “It wasn’t ever like we’d be shopping and go back to her house and I’d flirt with her husband. Yes, I got together with Heather’s soon-to-be ex-husband, but no, I didn’t have an affair with him.”</p><h2 id=paris-hilton-amp-nicole-richie><strong>Paris Hilton & Nicole Richie</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> & <a href=#>Nicole Richie</a> appeared to be the ultimate BFFs. Paris and Nicole were childhood best friends who grew up together. They took their friendship to the next level when they starred in the hit reality series The Simple Life. Right before the series began airing, a s*x tape featuring Paris was leaked. The combination of the reality series, the tape, and her personality helped turned Paris into an international celebrity. Nicole did well for herself but nowhere near the popularity that Paris had achieved. It’s speculated that jealously and media attention contributed to the end of the friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Paris acknowledged that they weren’t friends anymore but didn’t elaborate further. However, they appear to be on better terms in recent years. In 2014, Richie was asked about the friendship/feud and said, “The short answer to this is, I haven’t spoken to her in a while, but we are very good friends. I love her and I love her family. I have a lot of respect for her.”</p><h2 id=tiffani-thiessen-amp-jennie-garth><strong>Tiffani Thiessen & Jennie Garth</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennie Garth</a> and <a href=#>Tiffani Thiessen</a> went on one wild ride as friends. They first started out as enemies, later became BFFs before becoming enemies once again. Both women rose to fame in the ‘90s and were every boy’s dream girl. In 1994, Thiessen joined the cast of the hit series Beverly Hills, 90210 when she replaced the departing <a href=#>Shannen Doherty</a>. Jennie was known for playing the role of Kelly Taylor in 90210. It was well-known that Garth and Doherty didn’t get along at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Tiffani Thiessen first joined the series, Jennie Garth was cold and mean towards her. Garth later apologized for her attitude and then became best friends. They were so close that Thiessen was in the room when Jennie gave birth the first time. However, the friendship fell apart and neither woman has ever explained why. During an interview with <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>, Thiessen noted that the friendship started out “rough” and ended the same way it began. She also pointed out that she was the one that was hurt but didn’t elaborate further.</p><h2 id=jennifer-garner-amp-mark-ruffalo><strong>Jennifer Garner & Mark Ruffalo</strong></h2><p>It might be hard for some to believe, but even a guy and a girl can be BFFs. Just because they’re extremely close, doesn’t mean there is something going on between them. However, it’s somewhat difficult to be best friends with the opposite gender while also getting into a relationship. Technically, <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a> and <a href=#>Mark Ruffalo</a> were never BFFs because they never got the chance to get there. According to Ruffalo, while shooting the film 13 Going On 30, he and Garner became very close. The potential to be best friends forever was certainly there. That was until <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> entered the picture. Around the time that Garner started dating Affleck, her friendship with Ruffalo fizzled away. A fan once asked Ruffalo if he and Garner remained friends. He said, “We had a great time together, and I think we would have.” Ruffalo also said, “But then Ben came on the scene and that was the end of that.” Some BFFs are just not meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-montag-amp-lauren-conrad><strong>Heidi Montag & Lauren Conrad</strong></h2><p>The whole world got to see the evolution and dissolution of BFFs <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a> and <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a> during their time as the stars of the reality series,&nbsp;The Hills. Heidi and Lauren were once inseparable and did pretty much everything together. Like many best friends, Conrad didn’t approve of Montag’s choice of boyfriend, <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a>. Conrad once described him as a “sucky person.” Their public feud exploded when Montag chose Pratt over Conrad.</p><p>Rumors swirled that Heidi revealed there was a s*x tape starring Lauren and former boyfriend, <a href=#>Jason Wahler</a>. Montag denied this but it was clearly too late. During one encounter, Conrad yelled at Montag, “You know what you did!” Heidi did attempt to resolve their issues but Lauren wanted nothing to do with her. Lauren told Heidi, “I want to forgive you and I want to forget you.” Heidi Montag and Lauren Conrad are no longer friends, and Montag is now married to Spencer Pratt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=winona-ryder-amp-gwyneth-paltrow><strong>Winona Ryder & Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p>In the ‘90s, besties <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a> & <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> had the world buzzing with their friendship. Ryder & Paltrow became very tight friends when dating <a href=#>Matt Damon</a> and Ben Affleck, respectively. They were inseparable and had spent most of their time together. However, their professional life would soon interfere with the famous duo’s friendship. The friendship came to an end when Paltrow beat out Ryder for the role of Viola in Shakespeare in Love. Gwyneth Paltrow then went on to win an Oscar for her critically acclaimed performance, which probably didn’t help the situation. They stopped being friends and both went their separate ways. Years later during an interview with Howard Stern, Paltrow revealed that she had not seen Winona Ryder in years. She also denied stealing the role from Ryder and said, “That's an urban myth. I swear to God I did not.” Regardless, they are no longer BFFs and haven’t spoken in years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-john-amp-george-michael><strong>Elton John & George Michael</strong></h2><p>Icons <a href=#>Elton John</a> & <a href=#>George Michael</a>&nbsp;were BFFs long before the phrase was popular. They formed a deep friendship and bond that would last for several years. Well, until Elton John felt the need to comment on his bestie, George. Michael was known to enjoy staying at home. John, on the other hand, had taken advantage of his worldwide stardom. In 2004, Elton felt the need to comment on his best friends lifestyle when he said, “He's quite happy just being at home all the time, and I think that's a waste of talent. There seems to be a deep-rooted unhappiness in his life and it shows on his latest album.” To say George Michael was unhappy about this comment would be an understatement. In fact, George replied to Elton and said, “Elton John knows nothing about George Michael.” In 2006, the iconic duo made up with John saying, “George and I are fine. He came and stayed down (at) my house last year.” Luckily, they have worked things out before George Michael died at the end of 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow-amp-madonna><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow & Madonna</strong></h2><p>BFFs Gwyneth Paltrow and <a href=#>Madonna</a> were lighting the world on fire in the 2000s. These two best friends have a lot in common but their love of fitness brought them together. At one time, they even shared the same personal trainer, Tracy Anderson. Anderson became very close with both Paltrow and Madonna. Anderson helped Paltrow “get in touch with her soulful side” and taught her how to dance. Additionally, she was a valuable asset to Madonna and had traveled with her for two years.</p><p>Everything was perfect in Paltrow & Madonna land until Madonna made a decision that would infuriate Paltrow. In 2011, Madonna stopped using Tracy Anderson as her personal trainer and Paltrow was enraged. Paltrow revealed the situation and how hurt she was in her lifestyle blog, Goop. She even asked what to do “when you don’t like a friend anymore.” She also discussed how Madonna made her feel without mentioning her name and said certain individuals left her feeling “drained, empty, and belittled.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-murray-amp-harold-ramis><strong>Bill Murray & Harold Ramis</strong></h2><p>The friendship and falling out between <a href=#>Bill Murray</a> and <a href=#>Harold Ramis</a> is a lesson for us all. Murray and Ramis were once very close and have both created/starred in some of the greatest comedic films together, such as&nbsp;Caddyshack, Stripes, and Ghostbusters. They had been good friends for several years until they teamed up to make the classic comedy Groundhog Day. According to Ramis, while shooting Groundhog Day, Murray was difficult to deal with and was very depressed. Murray was unhappy about not getting his way and made the situation difficult for everyone involved.</p><p>It’s also been well-known that for years, there have been several attempts to make a Ghostbusters III. However, Bill was the only one that wasn’t eager to make a third film due to the fact that he isn’t a big fan of sequels. Despite the feud, Harold never said a bad word about Bill. Sadly, Harold Ramis died in 2014 and the former BFFs never reconciled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leighton-meester-amp-blake-lively><strong>Leighton Meester & Blake Lively</strong></h2><p>Here is some advice to all the BBFs out there. Make sure to congratulate your bestie if they ever get engaged. <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> and <a href=#>Leighton Meester</a> co-starred in the hit series Gossip Girl. Their characters were known for their love-hate relationship. It appears that their onscreen relationship wasn’t that different from real life. The friendship was stronger in the early years of the series but that soon unraveled. Lively and Meester were not getting along during the last two seasons. However, the straw that broke the camel’s back was when Lively didn’t call to congratulate Meester for her engagement to <a href=#>Adam Brody</a>. After the filming was completed, they decided not to remain friends or keep in touch. Co-star <a href=#>Chace Crawford</a> commented on the tense relationship saying, “There are obviously always little dramas. You are on set for 16 hours, so people get irritable. In any workplace, there are always little things and frustrations.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-amp-ariana-grande><strong>Jennette McCurdy & Ariana Grande</strong></h2><p>To be clear, many of the problems between <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy</a> and <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> have never been confirmed. For the most part, they’re all just rumors. McCurdy and Grande first became BFFs when they starred in the Disney series Sam & Cat. The series was hugely popular and much like their friendship, appeared to have a long future ahead. However, after a long hiatus, the show was suddenly cancelled.</p><p>Rumors suggest that part of the reason for the cancellation is due to issues between McCurdy and Grande. There was speculation that McCurdy wasn’t thrilled that Grande was being paid more than her. At the same time, Grande’s music career was taking off and racy pics of McCurdy were leaked online. However, McCurdy believes that people were looking for a problem where there wasn’t one. McCurdy also mentioned that, “…we text probably like once a week to kind of catch up and see what’s going on.” They do appear to have drifted apart over the last few years and are not as close as they used to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-amp-demi-lovato><strong>Miley Cyrus & Demi Lovato</strong></h2><p>Pop sensations <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> and <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> went from being inseparable BFFs to acquaintances in a few short years. Both shot to fame as child stars when working for Disney Channel. They each starred on separate hit Disney series and soon became worldwide successes. It was during this time that they formed a bond and became best of friends. In fact, in 2013, Demi said, “Miley has been one of my best friends growing up.”</p><p>Everything appeared to be perfect for the besties living in the magical world of Disney. However, not too long after that interview, their friendship ceased. No real reason or explanation was ever given for the sudden end. Demi Lovato did shed some light on the situation during an interview where she called Miley an “acquaintance.” She went on to explain, “It’s life, and people change. I don’t have anything in common with her anymore. I wish her the best.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-amp-kevin-smith><strong>Ben Affleck & Kevin Smith</strong></h2><p>In 1995, <a href=#>Ben Affleck</a> was an unknown actor, but he got his first big break when cast in the cult classic Mallrats. This would be the beginning of his career and a beautiful friendship with filmmaker <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>. Affleck and Smith became very good friends and have worked together for several years. In fact, Affleck starred in several memorable Kevin Smith films, including&nbsp;Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.</p><p>However, in 2004, Affleck and Smith suddenly stopped being friends and no explanation was given. In 2014, Kevin Smith finally revealed part of the reason why they’re not anymore friends and it’s somewhat related to <a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>. When asked if Affleck would make a good Batman, Kevin Smith replied, “Great question. I don’t know, because we’re not f*****g tight. I have not been [close with him] in decades. That’s old Ben. He’s got a wife that don’t care for me at all. And plus, honestly, he probably don’t care for me at all anymore.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-amp-kim-kardashian><strong>Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> were once the best of friends. They have a lot in common and both share similar interests. Both are socialites that come from rich families. They are reality TV superstars and had celebrity s*x tapes leaked. Kim and Paris were pretty good friends before either one of them even became famous. Paris became an overnight sensation and had all the attention. During that time, Kim was right by her BFF’s side. In fact, Paris employed Kim as her assistant and had her clean out her closet.</p><p>Around 2009, the friendship fell apart partly because Kim started getting more attention and Paris became yesterday’s news. They had a falling out but Kim rarely talked about Paris or simply didn’t acknowledge her existence. Paris, on the other hand, insulted Kim a few times and even implied that the entire Kardashian family owes their fame to her. During an interview, Paris discussed Kim’s famous derriere and said it “reminds [her] of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag.” In 2014, Kim and Paris reconciled and shared an Instagram pic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-amp-katy-perry><strong>Taylor Swift & Katy Perry</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> & <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> had a friendship and feud that puts Mean Girls to shame. In 2009, Taylor and Katy became good friends and the friendship kept evolving. Taylor had a great time at Katy’s birthday and called it “party-licious” and the “Best EVER” on Twitter. One would assume their falling out might have had something to do with both dating <a href=#>John Mayer</a>&nbsp;at different times. It wasn’t Mayer that came between these two BFFs but instead, backup dancers.</p><p>In 2012, three backup dancers from Katy Perry’s California Dreams tour joined Taylor Swift’s Red tour. However, those dancers then left to join Perry’s Prism tour. Taylor was so upset that she unfollowed the dancers on Twitter and wrote the song “Bad Blood” about the situation. In a Rolling Stone interview, Taylor said, “I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?’” She also said that they soon turned into “straight up enemies.” In response, Katy Tweeted, “Watch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: refinery29</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2brq671Kxkm56WqHq1tMCtZJudk5a6pnnBoqutnaJisq%2BxzKKcrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-famous-bffs-that-became-bitter-enemies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-successful-actors-who-aren-t-very-attractive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-successful-actors-who-aren-t-very-attractive.html>20 Successful Actors who Aren't Very Attractive</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-one-direction-members-have-been-up-to-since-their-split.html>What One Direction Members Have Been Up To Since Their Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-one-direction-members-have-been-up-to-since-their-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
