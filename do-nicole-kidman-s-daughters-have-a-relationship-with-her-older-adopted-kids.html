Nicole’s strained relationship with Isabella and Connor has many fans wondering if they have a relationship with her younger daughters.

"My kids don't call me mommy. They don't even call me mom," she said in an interview. "They call me Nicole, which I hate and tell them off for it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Keith Urban And Nicole Kidman Have Said About Lockdown Life With Their Family</a></span></p><p>Since marrying Keith Urban in 2006, Nicole has been splitting her time between her native Sydney, Australia and Nashville Tennessee.

This also means they likely don’t have a close relationship to their younger half-sisters.</p><p>Nicole seemed to indirectly imply their relationship is strained in 2018 when she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">failed to mention her adopted kids</a> in a Golden Globes awards acceptance speech, though she mentioned Keith and their two daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s also been speculation that Isabella and Connor’s involvement in scientology – which their father famously practices – has caused distance between them and Nicole. The Big Little Lies star has never spoken badly about scientology, though she’s never been a practicing member. Rather, Nicole has expressed respect towards her kids’ beliefs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Keith Urban Has Said About Meeting His Wife, Nicole Kidman</a></span></p><p>"I've chosen not to speak publicly about Scientology. I have two children who are Scientologists—Connor and Isabella—and I utterly respect their beliefs,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nicole stated to the Hollywood Reporter in 2013</a>.</p><p>She later addressed the topic in 2018, saying, "They are adults. They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it's my job to love them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Likewise, Isabella and Connor have never spoken badly about their famous mother to the press. Instead, they’ve defended their relationships with her on multiple occasions. "I love mom. She's my mom. She's great. I see her sometimes and I speak to her...We're a very close family. I love all of our family,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Isabella told New Idea in 2012</a>.</p><p>Similarly, Connor said in 2014, "I love my mom. I don't care what people say, I know that me and Mum are solid. I love her a lot. My family means everything. Yeah, I love my music, but the family comes before everything else."</p><h2 id=connor-amp-isabella-likely-aren-rsquo-t-close-to-tom-rsquo-s-younger-daughter-either>Connor & Isabella Likely Aren’t Close To Tom’s Younger Daughter, Either</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/since-tom-cruise-isn-t-involved-in-her-life-did-suri-change-her-last-name_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s not only Sunday and Faith that Connor and Isabella don’t appear close to. They also have a younger sister through Tom’s marriage to Katie Holmes. The couple – who were married from 2006 to 2012 – welcomed a daughter, Suri, in 2006. However, the actress obtained full custody after their quick divorce, which was finalized within a matter of weeks.</p><p>Some reports say that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tom hasn’t seen Suri in years</a>, so it’s highly likely that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Isabella and Connor haven’t had much of a relationship</a> with her since Tom and Katie’s split.</p><p>Katie has never addressed her divorce and custody situation with Tom, but it’s been speculated that Scientology may have played a part in the break-up. She’s now sending Suri to a Catholic school. Conversely, Isabella and Connor are both outspoken members of the Church of Scientology, just like Tom, which likely complicates their relationship with their other siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqGWenrCwuMRmoqKcnZa7brDArp6hrJWnwG60wK%2BcZpldp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsPIrZ9moJWnerC4w56pZpmUpL21scNmoqKco2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdo-nicole-kidman-s-daughters-have-a-relationship-with-her-older-adopted-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gma-s-amy-robach-and-t-j-holmes-spark-dating-rumors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gma-s-amy-robach-and-t-j-holmes-spark-dating-rumors.html>GMA's Amy Robach and T.J.
