Either way, there is no denying the fans love their dress sense and each new style becomes a trend for the followers.</p><h2 id=beyonc>Beyoncé</h2><p><a href=#>Beyoncé </a>is probably the biggest of the trendsetters. She is one of pop’s most iconic figures. With over 129 million Instagram followers, Beyoncé moves the world of pop with every move she makes. With her ever-loyal fans, Beyoncé is known for some of the spiciest dresses in fashion today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Beyonce Does To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>Beyoncé is a mega influencer, sorry, THE mega influencer in pop fashion today. But she wasn’t always the savvy dresser she is today. Back in the day, her style was somewhat dry and, well, not so appealing, or rather not something to cause awe. Today she appears in some of the most glamorous of clothing and her eager fans are ever so ready to move in her footsteps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande>Ariana Grande</h2><p>Ariana Grande is the second influencer and the youngest on this list. Her style appeals to the younger generation but is also an eye-catcher for the older. Grande can be described as a hurricane, with her massive influence, she has over 146 million Instagram followers. Her style is flirty, fun and has elements that can easily be recognized as feminine, elements such as fragility and tenderness, as opposed to the masculine trend of leather clothing or buckles (though she has spiced up her looks with a bit of leather in recent times). Grande has a true petite style of dressing and has a horde of people following in her lead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna>Rihanna</h2><p><a href=#>Rihanna</a> is a pop icon. She is loved in the music industry as well as the fashion industry. Rihanna doesn’t just dress to impress, she dresses to sell. She is the owner of Fenty Beauty. She is probably the biggest risk-taker in the fashion world today. Even before the rise of Fenty Beauty, Rihanna has been dressing to kill. Constantly mixing up a sartorial concoction that seems unappealing at first, until Rihanna wears it then it looks awesome. Her influence in fashion can be seen in the success of Fenty Beauty which has made Rihanna the current richest female pop star, surpassing even the likes of Beyoncé. Rihanna has over 66 million Instagram followers.</p><h2 id=kanye-west>Kanye West</h2><p>With over 383 thousand Instagram followers, Kanye West is known for his outrageous dressing style. The musician is notable for some rather non-traditional outfits, often appearing in public with what you’d consider ‘odd.’ No seriously. Ye’s clothing is sometimes odd beyond imagination. Though Kanye isn’t always adorned in eye-popping clothing, he ensures to do it often enough so we don’t forget all about it. The singer, on a good day, favors loosely fitting denim with a bit of crazy, both on the pants and shirts and is often seen wearing baggy shirts and tends to go more with darker colors. Kanye launched his own clothing line, Yeezy, and merged his shoe line with Nike in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-bieber>Justin Bieber</h2><p>The loverboy is in a league of his own when it comes to fashion. His style is simply HIS style. Justin Bieber’s dressing style has evolved since his rise to fame at the age of 14 when he was signed to Def Jam Recordings.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Ridiculously Expensive Things That Justin Bieber Bought</a></p><p>He tends to favor bright colors and oversized shirts. He has a clothing line, Drew House (launched early this year), with the slogan ‘wear like you don’t care.’ Which is exactly what Bieber himself does. He wears like he doesn’t care. Bieber has over 122 million Instagram followers. His style appeals mostly to the younger generation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwen-stefani>Gwen Stefani</h2><p>Gwen likes her jeans most and she is often seen wearing a leather jacket. Stefani isn’t one to be left behind in the fashion world, she sets her own tone. Her love for stilettos and pumps can hardly be overemphasized. She has her own clothing line, L.A.M.B. launched in 2003. While Gwen sometimes goes with skimpy tops, most times actually, in her own rebellious way, she tends to stick with her signature style, which is trousers, stilettos and leather jackets. <a href=#>Gwen Stefani </a>has over 9 million Instagram followers, with hungry eyes always waiting for the next stunning appearance from the singer.</p><h2 id=john-legend>John Legend</h2><p>John Legend is best known for his single <i>All Of Me</i> which peaked at number 1 on Billboard Hot 100, in 2014, and became the second best-selling song of 2014 with 4.67 million copies sold that year. John isn’t just good with music, he is also looked up to for his amazing fashion sense. The American singer is known for his simplistic and mature dress style. Legend, nevertheless, never fails to stun in his outfits. The singer doesn’t wear overly expressive clothing, he also doesn’t wear outrageous clothing. His influence is mainly on those who prefer a quiet style. He has over 11 million Instagram followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga>Lady Gaga</h2><p><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> goes with the likes of Rihanna and Cardi B. Those are the ‘crazies.’ She never fails to capture the attention of the public with her sometimes elegant and glamorous style, other times weird style and most often than not bright and expressive style. Gaga is gaga in her dressing choices, taking into detail everything she wears from her head to her toes, ensuring they blend perfectly well to best convey her unconventional style and the fans love her for it. Ever need inspiration for something crazy but not so revealing? You’ll probably find something out of Lady Gaga’s public appearances. The pop icon has 38 million Instagram followers.</p><h2 id=katy-perry>Katy Perry</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Katy Perry is all about elegance, nothing too crazy, nothing too revealing, though she ensures to keep it sexy. Katy is conservative in her dressing, with over 87 million Instagram followers, she dresses for the classy, fun-loving lot. Katy has had crazy appearances, but nothing compared to the ‘crazies.’ Most times she makes her hair blonde style and favors a colorful look as opposed to dark clothing. Like many fashion trendsetters, Katy has gone through a lot of style changes through the years and continues to set the pace for her fans and anyone who has an eye for a more sedate style.</p><h2 id=cardi-b>Cardi B</h2><p>Next to Rihanna, Cardi B is probably the next craziest dresser. Cardi is a fashion whirlwind as can be seen in her overly expressive music videos. Her style is seductive and sexual. She has over 55 million Instagram followers, all waiting for the next Cardi moment. She has made jaw-dropping appearances at notable events including the 2019 Met Gala. Cardi pushes the limits of what is publicly acceptable, but that’s nothing new in the music industry. Like most celebrities, she dresses to attract attention, which is good for business. Cardi does it flawlessly like she was born for it. It’s amazing what she can combine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>White Porsches and Carats: The 10 Most Expensive Things Cardi B Owns</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWV6sbvPrKuaqqNiuKLA2GannqqirnqnrdKhoKimXafCr8PAsmSbnamku6Sxjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-popstars-who-are-fashion-trendsetters.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./blair-underwood-breaks-down-that-ambiguous-longlegs-ending-his-fate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./blair-underwood-breaks-down-that-ambiguous-longlegs-ending-his-fate.html>Blair Underwood Breaks Down That Ambiguous Longlegs Ending, His Fate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./high-school-musical-cast-where-are-they-now.html>'High School Musical' Cast: Where Are They Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./high-school-musical-cast-where-are-they-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
