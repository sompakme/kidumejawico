Sadly, things did not work out in the long run.</p><p>Let's look back on the show and see why it vanished.</p><h2 id=why-was-39-honeymoon-island-39-canceled>Why Was 'Honeymoon Island' Canceled?</h2><p>When it comes to the most popular dating shows on a small screen, there is nothing quite like a fresh season of Married at First Sight. The show sees complete and total strangers get married from the very first episode, and they spend the rest of the season figuring each other out while eventually deciding if they want to stay together, or end their nuptials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been so many variations of dating shows throughout the years, and this fresh concept was one that fans were champing at the bit to see. Each season has led to an incredible amount of drama and intrigue, and it's precisely why people keep coming back for more.</p><p>So far, there have been 13 seasons of the show, and a 14th season is on the way. Even though there have been so many seasons, fans are still excited to see what season 14 will bring to the table. It will be set in Boston, so you just know things are about to get wild on the show.</p><p>Thanks to the success of Married at First Sight, there have been spin-off shows that have come into play on the network. Some years back, a spin-off show came along, and it was unable to find any semblance of sustained success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why 'Married At First Sight' Couple Ryan Oubre And Clara Berghaus Divorced</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-honeymoon-island-39-was-a-spin-off>'Honeymoon Island' Was A Spin-Off</h2><p>In 2018, Married at First Sight: Honeymoon Island made it official debut on Lifetime.</p><p>In a description of the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, wrote, "Ranging in age from 25 to 40, the stars are a mix of new faces, fan favorites and unmatched candidates from earlier seasons of the original. At the end of their stay, participants must either get married or leave the island alone."</p><p>This was certainly a new and interesting way to put a spin on the show, and the previews promised and interesting inaugural season. Of course, no one was expecting it to live up to its predecessor, but there was some hope that the show would be a hit and would catch on with audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the end of the season, only a few couples decided to stick it out and be together for the long run. There was a lot of drama that was jam-packed into a single season of the show, and it definitely made for an interesting watch.</p><p>Even though Honeymoon Island did have some nice things working for it, at the end of the day, it was not enough to keep it around on the small screen, and it came to an untimely end after just a single season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Married At First Sight’: The Only Couple From Season 13 Who Are Still Together</a></span></p><h2 id=lifetime-gave-no-explanation-for-married-at-first-sight-honeymoon-island-39-s-departure>Lifetime Gave No Explanation For Married at First Sight: Honeymoon Island's Departure</h2><p>So, why did Married at First Sight: Honeymoon Island receive the boot from Lifetime? Well, the truth is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no official or formal announcement</a> was made about the show's cancellation. Instead, the show simply disappeared and never made a return to the small screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a number of reasons why the network could have elected to pull the plug on the show, and we have to imagine that ratings and reception played a part in this. Simply put, if the show had great ratings, then there is just no way that Lifetime would have ditched a valuable property so quickly.</p><p>If the show did pull down decent ratings, then perhaps it was the overall format that left a lot to be desired. After all, Married at First Sight is usually set within a single city, whereas Honeymoon Island featured people from various parts of the country. This definitely could have put some unnecessary strain on the developing relationships.</p><p>Regardless of the definitive reason, Honeymoon Island came and went several years ago, and it has never made a return to TV, which is quite the bummer for those that enjoyed its lone season on the air.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are AJ And Stephanie Still Married?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Lifetime does decide to dust off this show in the future, then you had better believe that fans will be ready for it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What The 'Married At First Sight' Cast Looks Like For Season 14</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecyaqauhlZl6osCMn6Crq6RiwKqzx61koaeemsauu86nZKKrnJa7pXnCmqWcnZyasXA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-the-married-at-first-sight-spin-off-honeymoon-island-canceled.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wwe-discussed-having-ozzy-osbourne-perform-at-wwe-survivor-series-war-games.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wwe-discussed-having-ozzy-osbourne-perform-at-wwe-survivor-series-war-games.html>WWE Discussed Having Ozzy Osbourne Perform At WWE Survivor Series: War Games</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-venus-and-serena-s-other-siblings-really-think-of-their-success.html>What Venus And Serena's Other Siblings Really Think Of Their Success</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-venus-and-serena-s-other-siblings-really-think-of-their-success.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
