We offered many times to have her come to mine bcz he would NEVER come face ME with that bullshit (believe it) but sadly she wouldn’t leave him. So, my ex would be calm and talk her down until Manson realized she was on the phone and he whoa’d down.</p><p>“But then he started calling in the early hours. I was told he was paranoid, gacked out of his mind, and accusing his wife of cheating with an imaginary person who had blonde hair with a blonde mustache named “Don” who he, I’m told, saw on his security cameras…,” Shamaya said.</p><p>It is to note that currently, Marilyn Manson is finding himself in a bind and amid controversy as many women along with her former partner <a href=#>Evan Rachel Wood</a> have accused Marilyn of being abusive towards them.
