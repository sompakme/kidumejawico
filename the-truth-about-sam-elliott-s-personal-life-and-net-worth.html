His impeccable skills as an actor have transformed Elliott into various characters over the years, with notable movies such as The Mask, The Quick, Road House, and most recently, A Star Is Born under his belt.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> He made his television debut in 1968 </a>and has been in front of the camera for decades, collecting an abundance of accolades along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His career is well documented, and his acting is highly acclaimed, but Elliott's personal life has remained under wraps - until now.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The private, low-key actor has established a formidable reputation </a>for himself, all the while managing to keep most of his personal details off-limits to fans.</p><h2 id=sam-elliott-used-to-be-a-frat-boy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Sam Elliott Used To Be A Frat Boy</span></h2><p>Sam Elliott may be a mature, seasoned actor now, but during his younger years, he happened to be a frat boy! It's hard to envision him involved in all the activities and parties that are typically associated with life in a fraternity, but during his school years, this was part of his exploration process. During his time in the University of Oregon, Elliott pledged at Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Almost Lost Her 'A Star Is Born' Role To This Famous Singer</a></span></p><h2 id=what-feuled-sam-elliott-39-s-acting-dreams><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Feuled Sam Elliott's Acting Dreams</span></h2><p>Elliott was destined to be an actor, and he revealed this to his parents at the tender young age of just 9 years old. At first, they thought this was a phase, but much to his father's dismay, Elliott remained fixated on becoming an actor. Elliott's dad disapproved of this choice and continually discouraged him from moving in this direction with his career, but in spite of not having his father's support, Elliott's tenacity and sheer passion for following his acting dreams led him to see huge success in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-sam-elliott-met-the-love-of-his-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Sam Elliott Met The Love Of His Life</span></h2><p>The world of acting proved to play an integral role in Elliott's love life, as well. During his time on set of the horror movie The Legacy in 1978, Elliott met an incredibly talented actress that immediately caught his eye. Katharine Ross and Sam Elliott immediately started dating, and their romance flourished into full-blown love and devotion for one another. They were married in 1984.</p><h2 id=sam-elliott-is-a-very-proud-papa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sam Elliott Is A Very Proud Papa</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On September 17th, 1984, Katharine and Sam welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world. The love they had for one another made them a family as they proudly took on their new role as parents. Their daughter was named Cleo Rose Elliott, and quickly became the center of their adoration. Elliott was smitten with his little girl, and maintains a very close bond with her today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Matthew Rondeau?

She has gone on to thrive as a musician, and has the full support of both her parents. She currently resides in Malibu and has a very deep connection to her roots and family. The Elliott family values their time together and put focus on spending as many moments together as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-elliott-39-s-feelings-about-social-media><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sam Elliott's Feelings About Social Media</span></h2><p>Unlike many actors that rely heavily on social media, Sam Elliott shuns the social media world entirely. He currently doesn't engage on any social media outlets, and relies on maintaining a connection with his fan base the good old-fashioned way- through his work. He doesn't like to broadcast his personal life online, and has spoken out about how much he dislikes the way people disengage from reality when on social media. “Everywhere you look, people are looking at their hands, In restaurants, it's like you're sitting in a patch of jack-o'-lanterns because everyone's face is lit up by their phone. Nobody's relating to each other," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-are-obsessed-with-sam-elliott-39-s-mustache><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fans Are Obsessed With Sam Elliott's Mustache</span></h2><p>The world may be obsessed with Elliott's signature mustache, but Sam Elliott doesn't quite understand what all the fuss is about. He is aware of the fact that fans have developed a fascination with the facial hair on his upper lip, but he truly doesn't see how that physical characteristic can generate so much buzz. Fans think differently and have been so fixated on his mustache that in 2015, Elliott was honored with an induction into the International Mustache Hall of Fame. He often plays down the very thing that everyone admires him for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Memes Helped Zack Snyder Discover Superman's CGI Mustache Removal In ‘Justice League’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-elliott-39-s-current-net-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sam Elliott's Current Net Worth</span></h2><p>After decades in the spotlight, and true dedication to his craft, Sam Elliott has seen incredible success, and has left a huge footprint in Hollywood. His current net worth stands at a staggering $20 million, and he seems determined to continue entertaining his fans, well into his senior years. The 77-year-old remains as passionate about acting now, as he was a young boy.</p><h2 id=sam-elliott-39-s-moral-code><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sam Elliott's Moral Code</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam Elliott has managed to keep his name away from the seemingly never ending controversy that typically surrounds big Hollywood stars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His solid moral code</a> plays a significant role in that. During a 1980 interview, Elliott revealed that the proverbial casting couch was very real and that in fact, he had been propositioned by both men and women over the years. Proving that his morals are intact and that he wasn't swayed by opportunity and the promise of fame and fortune, he says; "I’ve turned them all down. It’s probably hurt me, but I’m the one who has to live with that guilt. My conscience is clear, even though my career is still not setting the world on fire.”</p><h2 id=sam-elliott-39-s-simple-humble-life><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sam Elliott's Simple, Humble Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elliott has managed to keep his life full of love and laughter and has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">detached himself from the very artificial Hollywood lifestyle.</a> He and Katharine have opted to lead a more fulfilling, family-based lifestyle. He says; “We don’t believe all the sh*t in the rags. And we work hard. Katharine and I have a lot in common. We’ve got a 30-year-old daughter [Cleo] that we’re deeply in love with and still incredibly close to. Life’s good. We live in Malibu and have horses and dogs and cats and chickens. We shovel sh*t, man. That keeps you humble."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'The Ranch': Everything The Cast Is Up To Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6tK3MZpylpJmkwbW%2FjKmcq6ufo66tecuinZ5lkaOxbrrErWSwp6KptW7Ax55kq5memLVw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-truth-about-sam-elliott-s-personal-life-and-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-world-s-10-most-expensive-streets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-world-s-10-most-expensive-streets.html>The World's 10 Most Expensive Streets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mick-hucknall-net-worth-how-much-is-mick-hucknall-worth.html>Mick Hucknall Net Worth How Much is Mick Hucknall Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mick-hucknall-net-worth-how-much-is-mick-hucknall-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
