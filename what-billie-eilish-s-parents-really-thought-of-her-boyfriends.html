From music charts to memes, the hit single dominated the world for a while, and it launched Billie into the fame she has now. As a result, <a href=#>the singer is worth $53 million, and she definitely knows how to spend it</a>. In 2021, <a href=#>Billie and Apple TV collaborated for the documentary film The World's a Little Blurry</a>. Thanks to this, fans finally got the curtain pulled back on the star's day-to-day life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nobody expected to find out that Eilish was, in fact, dating somebody. The film shows all about the singer's relationship with her ex, Q, and even why it left her feeling sad and alone. Fast forward to 2022, and some fans are particularly concerned about the age difference between Eilish and her new boyfriend, Matthew Tyler Vorce. Matthew is 29 years old, which is ten years older than Billie. Are her parents as worried as fans? Here is what Billie's parents really think of the singer's love life.</p><h2 id=billie-eilish-39-s-tight-knit-bond-with-her-family>Billie Eilish's Tight-Knit Bond With Her Family</h2><p>Perhaps the whole world knows who Billie Eilish is, but many people forget the hard work she has gone through. A huge part of Billie and Finneas' formation rests on their parents' shoulders. The singer was not born into the wealthiest family. Her mother, Maggie Baird, worked as an actor, vocal artist, and screenwriter through the '90s and early '80s. While her father, Patrick O'Connell, played bit parts in a handful of shows and movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Some Fans Think Billie Eilish's Brother Finneas Is Creepy</a></span></p><p>Billie's tight-knit bond with her family is evident in The World's a Little Blurry, which features many scenes of goofing off with her brother and musical collaborator Finneas, as well as her parents, Maggie and Patrick. In one of the many heartwarming scenes, Billie even admitted one pretty comical revelation: "This is my parents' bed, and I sleep in here because I'm scared of monsters in my room." Fans thought her confession was adorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=billie-eilish-39-s-parents-respect-her-private-life>Billie Eilish's Parents Respect Her Private Life</h2><p>In another scene of the documentary, Billie and her mom get into a more intense conversation when the artist asks, "Why can't we just miss people though? Why do we have to cope? Why can't we just let it happen," to which her mom replied, "because it hurts."</p><p>Regarding the singer's love life, it seems like Maggie always supports her and respects her decisions. <a href=#>Billie's mom is a vital force in her famous daughter's life</a>. And although they might have deep conversations about boys, it's clear that they have them in private. On the other hand, Patrick is Billie's biggest fan. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Zane Lowe</a>, Eilish revealed, "My dad and I have had this relationship over the years of sharing music with each other. My dad has shown me some of my favorite songs in the world, and I've shown him songs that he loves and adores also." One thing is clear: Billie's parents want the best for her and avoid making public comments regarding their daughter's personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Billie Eilish's Boyfriend Matthew Tyler Vorce Have A High Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=some-of-billie-eilish-39-s-craziest-dating-rumors>Some of Billie Eilish's Craziest Dating Rumors</h2><p>Relationships are still complicated, even for Billie Eilish. In the documentary, viewers follow the singer's relationship as it begins to fall apart, and by the end of the film, fans see just how heartbroken Billie really is. This isn't the first time the star has had fans finding out about her love life. Some people may remember the story behind the song Wish You Were Gay. The internet was flooded with rumors as to what the song meant.</p><p>Was it Billie announcing her sexuality? What did it mean? The Ocean Eyes singer said, "I wrote this song about a guy that really was not interested in me, and it made me feel horrible." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It turns out the song was about someone she had a crush on</a>. But he was not interested in the young artist. The guy in question later came out as gay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speculation has surrounded Billie's love life for a while now, and some of the rumors have been wild. As proof of it, in 2018, it was rumored that the singer was dating Danielle Bregoli, better known as Bhad Bhabie. Everything started when Danielle posted a Snapchat of Billie saying, "you have to look like this to be my girlfriend." But the Bad Guy singer answered the rumor saying, "I'm not dating Danielle, you're st*pid. That's my baby sister." And since then, Billie has ignored Danielle's messages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were also rumors of Billie being involved with XXXTentacion, who passed away in 2018. None of this was ever really addressed as the rapper's legal problems overshadowed the gossip, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie herself received hate for mourning the passing of the musician</a>. Eilish said, "I don't deserve hate for loving him." Nowadays, the singer is dating Matthew Tyler Vorce, and although many fans are not happy with their age gap, her family supports her, and Billie seems happier than ever.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Billie Eilish’s Vogue Cover May Have Signaled A Massive Change In Her Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXaWus7HNrapmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqldZ31zfo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-billie-eilish-s-parents-really-thought-of-her-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./art-forum-list-of-art-discussions-and-forums.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./art-forum-list-of-art-discussions-and-forums.html>Art Forum List of Art Discussions and Forums</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tv-shows-and-movies-that-ll-give-you-the-fall-feels.html>TV Shows and Movies Thatll Give You the Fall Feels</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tv-shows-and-movies-that-ll-give-you-the-fall-feels.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
