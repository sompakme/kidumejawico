Contestants live in separate apartments, play a game, and see who will win.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's a lot of juicy news about this show, from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lance Bass's assistant pretending to be him</a>&nbsp;to learning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what the season 1 cast members are doing today</a>.</p><p>Fans are curious what it's like to be a contestant on&nbsp;The Circle, as it seems like quite a unique experience. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=life-in-the-apartments>Life In The Apartments</h2><p>There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several reality shows on Netflix</a>&nbsp;that have become super popular, and&nbsp;The Circle&nbsp;is definitely one of them.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Reality Blurred,&nbsp;The Circle&nbsp;is shot in an apartment building in Manchester.</p><p>Bill Cranley&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about his experience on The Circle</a>&nbsp;and in an interview with the&nbsp;Chicago Tribune, he said the apartment was really hot, as there was no air conditioning and they were told to keep windows closed. If they opened the windows, the worry was that they would hear the other people playing the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cranley said that at first, he stayed at an Airbnb that was close to where the show was being filmed. He said that the crew made sure he didn't know where he was going: "Anytime I had to go to the apartment, they put noise-canceling headphones on me and blindfolded me, same thing when we were doing promos for the show."</p><p>Cranley also said that the show filmed "24/7." He explained that when he needed to use the bathroom, he let the producers know, and they put cameras there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cranley also&nbsp;shared that producers would talk to him: he said, "The only person I was talking to the whole time was the producer from the sky, the voice of God through the PA system. And there were two of them, a night-shift one from the U.K and a day-shift one from the U.S. We all had our own producers. They were talking to me pretty much every minute of the hour, honestly. Every half hour, they’d check in. Sometimes, we’d talk for hours. They wouldn’t tell you what was going to happen next, but they did say, “Hey, you can relax for now.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Fans Really Think Of ‘Love Is Blind’</a></span></p><p>Shubham Goel shared with&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;that there was a therapist who the contestants could speak to. He also had positive things to say about the producers: "Production-wise, [the producers] were the nicest people possible. There was a therapist you could see whenever you wanted. They have people constantly giving us food, doing the room."</p><p>According to&nbsp;Elite Daily, the first season was shot in only 15 days. As for what the players did in&nbsp;their free time, the contestants could watch Netflix sometimes. They could also use the gym or go up on the roof to get some fresh air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the apartments themselves, a ton of thought was put into them. In an interview with&nbsp;Slate, production designer Catherine Land explained the process of designing them: "I create 10 different ones, but then the producers decide who to put in the rooms because they go, 'Oh, that person’s really great to go in that room. They’d love that room.' They pair them with the rooms, basically."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Keeping Up With The Kardashians’: The Final Season: What To Expect From The ‘KUWTK’ Reunion</a></span></p><h2 id=other-experiences>Other Experiences</h2><p>Joey Sasso won the first season of the U.S. version of&nbsp;The Circle. He said that he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanted to have a good time on the show</a> and wasn't totally certain of what it was when he signed on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with&nbsp;AZ Central, Sasso explained, "I really didn't even understand the concept (of the show) myself. I just understood I'm alone, (and) it's a reality show. I'm going to go have a good time and see what happens."</p><p>He drew a lot during his free time while filming season 1, and he said that while books were fine,&nbsp;contestants&nbsp;couldn't have their computers or cell phones with them.</p><p>Sasso told&nbsp;People&nbsp;that he wanted to be himself during the game and that he thinks that being friends with some of the other players is also a good strategy.</p><p>Chloe Veitch and Tea&nbsp;DeLessa have also talked about starring on season 2 of&nbsp;The Circle.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;BuzzFeed, DeLeessa said that she took a lot of naps while the show was filming, and as for how long the chats between players lasted, it turns out that they lasted for hours. They seemed to be a few minutes long, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Netflix’s ‘Marriage Or Mortgage’ Real Or Fake?</a></span></p><p>It seems like it would be a fascinating and fun experience to star on&nbsp;The Circle, and it's cool to learn more about life inside the apartments.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">’90 Day Fiance’: Kelly Reacts To Molly Admitting That She Can’t Have Kids</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecitZKudkaG5unnLoqKeZaOprrO%2ByKeeZqeeYsGpsYycoKubnJp8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-it-really-like-starring-on-the-circle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./which-tv-chef-has-the-highest-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./which-tv-chef-has-the-highest-net-worth.html>Which TV Chef Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sebastian-fundora-net-worth-2022-boxer-salary-and-earnings.html>Sebastian Fundora Net Worth 2022, Boxer Salary And Earnings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sebastian-fundora-net-worth-2022-boxer-salary-and-earnings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
