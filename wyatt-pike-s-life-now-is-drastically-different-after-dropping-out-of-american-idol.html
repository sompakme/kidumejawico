With that in mind, it always seems like a huge deal when someone leaves Idol for atypical reasons.</p><p>In the past, Idol <a href=#>judges have left the show for artistic reasons</a> and <a href=#>competitors have been asked to leave following controversies</a>. While those instances are shocking, they pale in comparison to when competitors willingly quit the show.</p><p>In April 2021, Idol fans were shocked to learn that Wyatt Pike had taken himself out of the running to win the show. Given that Pike made the momentous decision to exit Idol, it likely won't surprise anyone that his life has changed a lot since then.</p><h2 id=why-did-wyatt-pike-leave-suddenly-leave-american-idol>Why Did Wyatt Pike Leave Suddenly Leave American Idol?</h2><p>Over the years, there have been some<a href=#> American Idol finalists who've become incredibly rich and famous</a>.

Then, it was announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pike decided to leave the sh</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ow</a> of his own volition</p><p>In the aftermath of Pike's decision, Ryan Seacrest announced his departure during the show. "Before we get to the results, I have to tell you that finalist Wyatt Pike will not be competing in the competition. He had to drop out, but we wish him the very best."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 'American Idol' Finalists Who Had Successful Careers (Even Though They Didn't Win)</a></span></p><p>Based on those words, many fans were left wondering why Pike "had to drop out". At that time, the only other information that was known about the situation was that a rep for Idol told People that "Wyatt could not continue due to personal reasons."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only a few days later, Pike went on Instagram to explain the reasons for his decision but at that time, he didn't reveal much more.</p><p>"I had to leave the @AmericanIdol competition for personal reasons but am so thankful I get to play music for the rest of my life. Fellow contestants - miss you all, good luck!

While that is an opportunity most people wouldn't pass up, Pike seems to prioritize collaborating with other people instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/katy-perry-luke-bryan-and-lionel-richie.jpg><p>Just over a year after Pike's Idol exit, it was announced that the talented singer was going on "The Growing Season Tour". At that time, Pike had recently put out a single titled "Deep Blue" and months before that his EP called "Growing Season" came out.</p><p>After rising to fame, some people may have expected Pike to be going on tour with some other notable names like Idol winners and fan favorites. Instead, Pike's tour mates are proof positive of what he learned from his Idol experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/american-idol-carrie-underwood.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As kpcw.org reported, Pike decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">go on tour with some fellow musicians he met as a youngster </a>through the Park City High School music program.</p><p>“We grew up in [that program] together and have kept playing music since.

While talking to parkrecord.com, Pike explained that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn't want to be overly competitive with his peers</a>.</p><p>“At the end of the day, competitive music on reality TV, I discovered, is not my thing. As many great things I learned and gained from it, all kinds of stress and the nine yards associated with that just became too much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/american-idol-judges-paula-abdul-simon-cowell-and-randy-jackson.jpg><p>Pike also went on to detail what he learned from Idol and based on his statements, it seems like the experience made him a better artist.</p><p>“There are so many components that went into that show, especially behind the scenes.
