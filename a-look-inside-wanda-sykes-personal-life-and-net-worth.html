Celebrities tend to keep work and life separate. Although she does share some stuff with her fans, mostly through stories in her stand-up, Sykes does tend to keep her personal life private. She was just announced as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the host for 2022's Oscars</a>. Let's find out a bit more about her before she takes on hosting duties. Here is a look inside Wanda Sykes' personal life and current net worth.</p><h2 id=wanda-sykes-39-early-family-life><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Wanda Sykes' Early Family Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wanda Sykes was born on March 7, 1964, in Portsmouth, Virginia. When she was in third grade,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> her family moved to Maryland</a>. Sykes' mother, Marion Louise, worked as a banker, and her father, Harry, was a U.S. Army Colonel. She had an older brother named Harry. Sykes attended high school in Maryland and then went on to attend Hampton University, where she earned a degree in marketing.</p><h2 id=wanda-sykes-39-first-marriage><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Wanda Sykes' First Marriage</span></h2><p>Sykes married record producer Dave Hall in 1991. Hall is known for working with artists like <strong><a href=#>Madonna </a></strong>and Mary J. Blige. Sykes and Hall remained married until 1998. The two have never really spoken about why the marriage ended. She did, however, poke fun at her marriage during her stand-up routines, which maybe weren't all in good fun. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Years later, Sykes told Oprah Winfrey</a> that she had "felt little connection with her husband" during their marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanda-sykes-39-coming-out-story><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Wanda Sykes' Coming Out Story</span></h2><p>One major reason she might have ended her marriage to Hall is because Sykes is a lesbian. In 2008, at the age of 44, Sykes publicly came out. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sykes attended an equality rally in Las Vegas during that year</a> and let the world know how she really identified. She came out to her parents when she was 40, who were both very conservative. They refused to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attend her to wedding to her wife</a> and had a falling out with their daughter because of it, but they have all since reconciled.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Wanda Sykes' Wife Alex Niedbalski, And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-second-marriage><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Second Marriage</span></h2><p>Wanda Sykes met Alex Niedbalski in 2006. She first spotted Niedbalski on a ferry ride to Fire Island in New York. A friend formerly introduced them and the rest was history. Niedbalski, a French woman, sold countertops at the time. Just about one month before Sykes attended the same-sex rally in 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and Alex were married without anyone knowing.</a> They are set to celebrate their 14th anniversary this year.</p><h2 id=wanda-sykes-and-alex-niedbalski-39-s-children><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Wanda Sykes And Alex Niedbalski's Children</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neither Wanda nor Alex have shared pictures of their children on social media, but according to PEOPLE, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple welcomed fraternal twins in 2009</a>. Neidbalski carried the twins, and they were born on April 27 of that year. They had a son, Lucas Claude, and a daughter, Olivia Lou. They will be 13 years old this April.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Other Comedians Feel About John Mulaney</a></span></p><h2 id=wanda-sykes-39-life-changing-diagnosis><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Wanda Sykes' Life-Changing Diagnosis</span></h2><p>In September 2011, Wanda Sykes appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and announced she had been diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in her left breast, which is a zero-stage breast cancer. However, to make sure she didn't get breast cancer in the future, Sykes underwent a double mastectomy. It began when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she went in to get a routine breast reduction surgery</a>, she explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Comedian Gabriel Iglesias Keeps His Relationships Private</a></span></p><h2 id=where-she-spends-most-of-her-time><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Where She Spends Most Of Her Time</span></h2><p>The Sykes' split their time between Los Angeles, California, and Media, Pennsylvania. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She likes the hustle and bustle of busy city life and also to get away sometimes to a small, quiet town,</a> according to an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer. Sykes and her wife show support to the sports teams in both states. Besides liking the quietness and simplicity of it, it is unknown why Sykes picked Media to settle in, since she was born in Virginia and lived most of her life in Maryland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanda-sykes-39-current-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Wanda Sykes' Current Net Worth</span></h2><p>Between acting, writing, and performing stand-up comedy, Wanda Sykes has made a great career for herself.
