Of course, the show would go on for another three seasons, wrapping up during season 12. Among the topics of conversation included the potential of Leonard and Penny having children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although they are expecting in the final season, Cuoco clearly feels indifferent at this point. Not only that, but she tells Colbert that she has no interest in working with babies either on the show, which gets a bit of mixed reaction from the audience on-hand.</p><p>She says, "I hope not, I don't like working with kids. I like kids, I don't want to work with them. Babies are really tough to work with. They're the biggest divas, people carry them in, and they only work like six minutes."</p><p>"They make any sounds they like. They talk, they cry. I just feel like the babies can do whatever the hell they want, and I don't think that's fair."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chuck-lorre-was-heavily-discouraged-from-working-with-a-big-bang-theory-star-who-was-described-as-_death-of-comedy_-by-cbs-imdb.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Chuck Lorre Was Heavily Discouraged From Working With A Big Bang Theory Star, Who Was Described As "Death Of Comedy" By CBS'>Chuck Lorre Was Heavily Discouraged From Working With A Big Bang Theory Star, Who Was Described As "Death Of Comedy" By CBS</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Chuck Lorre and CBS didn't always agree on cast members, and that held true for a particular guest star on The Big Bang Theory.</p><p>It was a hilarious rant by Cuoco and in the comments section, fans understood where the actress was coming from. As for the show's perspective, things took a turn for Leonard and Penny, one both actors weren't exactly ecstatic about.</p><h2 id=leonard-and-penny-ended-up-having-kids-but-kaley-cuoco-and-johnny-galecki-didn-39-t-exactly-agree>Leonard And Penny Ended Up Having Kids, But Kaley Cuoco And Johnny Galecki Didn't Exactly Agree</h2><p>It was hinted throughout the season that children wasn't in the cards for Leonard and Penny. Therefore, <a href=#>Galecki was shocked when he first saw the finale plan</a>. The actor admits he didn't understand it at first.</p><p>“The pregnancy shocked me. I didn’t get it at first.

We wanted to leave the audience with the idea that these friendships and the love that they have continues.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco also understood the decision, but was open to not having children.</p><p>"I actually wished that they did not [make Penny pregnant] because I loved that message [of Penny not wanting kids] so much." She goes on to say, "I was actually voting for her not to [get pregnant]."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-21t183817-748.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Big Bang Theory Guest Star Finally Spoke Ill About The Show, Wanting Off The Show After A Nightmare Week">A Big Bang Theory Guest Star Finally Spoke Ill About The Show, Wanting Off The Show After A Nightmare Week</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>He was set to appear on 10 episodes of The Big Bang Theory, but requested his exit after just one show.</p><p>Showrunner Steve Holland provided some clarity over the decision, feeling as though he wanted to honor Leonard's statement from the pilot episode.</p><p>"At the same time, we still tried to honor her feelings about having been against it earlier in the season," he stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Their relationship was really the jumping-off point of this whole show, and it felt important to us to honor that relationship.

Cuoco discussed what it would be like for Penny to be a mom, and she had no doubt that her character would succeed as a mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kaley-cuoco-johnny-galecki.jpg><p>“I was super happy. I didn’t expect it at all because they’ve been playing against it for so long.

They waited so many years, and they’re so fun and easygoing. Or Penny is really kind of easygoing! I think they’d be adorable parents. I can only imagine.”</p><p>If a reboot of sorts would ever take place, fans would love to see where Penny and Leonard are in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqSVrnqkwc6cpmafn6l6onnMoq%2BenF2nsqKv06Kmp2WRm8GmvoytnKWkmaO0br%2FTnqehnZ5isLC4wZ6prWWnnbxuv8eeZJ2hlKPBbsPAp6tmrJ9ixLC%2BymauoqyYYryvedObma1n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkaley-cuoco-got-a-mixed-reaction-after-telling-stephen-colbert-who-she-didn-t-want-to-work-with-on-t.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kyle-richards-kathy-hilton-s-falling-out-over-american-woman-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kyle-richards-kathy-hilton-s-falling-out-over-american-woman-more.html>Kyle Richards, Kathy Hiltons Falling Out Over 'American Woman,' More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jordan-gooden-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Jordan Gooden Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jordan-gooden-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
