Especially after her reality series with then-husband Nick Lachey, some thought the songstress wasn't too bright. But it turned out Jessica was far more than her one-liners on Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. Her music turned heads, then her fashion sense took over the 2000s, and today, she's a big star in her own right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the day, though, Jessica linked up with big-name stars that some fans are surprised she ever rubbed elbows with. One of those stars is Eva Longoria. But after Eva appeared in a music video with Jessica ages ago, did the two continue to maintain a friendship — or was it just for the cameras?</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-39-s-music-video-for-39-a-public-affair-39-turned-heads>Jessica Simpson's Music Video For 'A Public Affair' Turned Heads</h2><p>In 2006, Jessica Simpson's music video for 'A Public Affair' came out, and it was a big reveal in multiple ways. For one thing, the song was the debut single for her album, which came out later that year.</p><p>But 2006 was also the year that <a href=#>Jessica's divorce from Nick Lachey was finalized</a>, about a year after their reality series went off the air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was likely a challenging yet evolutionary time for Jessica, and her music video spoofed her everyday life with paparazzi hounding her (and her friends).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Were Jessica Simpson And Nick Lachey Still Married When He First Met Vanessa?">Were Jessica Simpson And Nick Lachey Still Married When He First Met Vanessa?</a></span></p><p>The video, as MTV explained, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">featured a handful of then-high-profile celebrities</a>, including Christina Applegate, Any Dick, Ryan Seacrest, Christina Milian, and more. In fact, entertainment host Maria Menounos portrayed a jealous girlfriend in the 'fantasy' clip where Maria imagines fighting Jessica.</p><p>The fan reaction to the music video might have been confusion, at first, but ages later, YouTube commenters are still loving on the video.</p><p>While some of the people in the video were casual connections (for example, MTV says Jessica called Christina Milian "hot and beautiful and talented," hence the invite), Jessica reportedly had closer friendships with the other actors in her video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-called-eva-one-of-her-close-gal-pals>Jessica Called Eva One Of Her Close Gal Pals</h2><p>In their recap of the music video for 'A Public Affair,' MTV wrote that Jessica called Eva Longoria "one of my best friends." She elaborated only that they were "both Texas girls," with little other information about their friendship.</p><p>Given the fact that Jessica was seemingly able to use her celebrity connections to get Christina Milian and others on board for the video, some fans wonder whether she's truly pals with Eva Longoria.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="10 Things Eva Longoria Has Done Since ‘Desperate Housewives’">10 Things Eva Longoria Has Done Since ‘Desperate Housewives’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time they filmed the music video, Eva was near the beginning of her epic Desperate Housewives run. While Longoria already had a history in television, <a href=#>thanks to The Young and the Restless</a>, among other projects, Desperate Housewives truly rocketed her into the spotlight.</p><p>And while Jessica seemed to retreat from the spotlight for a while after her divorce (it would later come out that <a href=#>she was quietly battling for control of her fashion empire</a>), Eva continued to act regularly.</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>Jessica still made headlines for her many failed relationships</a> (John Mayer, anyone?), but the real question is whether Eva was in the wings waiting to comfort her supposed BFF.</p><h2 id=are-eva-longoria-and-jessica-simpson-friends-today>Are Eva Longoria And Jessica Simpson Friends Today?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a while, it was rumored that there was beef between Eva and Jessica. After all, Jessica was notably absent from Eva's 2007 nuptials with Tony Parker. But at the time, TMZ reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica simply had another commitment that day</a>.</p><p>They pointed out that Jessica was invited, but that her cousin was also getting married the same day, in Texas. That marriage, of course, ended in 2011, and Eva married her third husband, José Bastón, in 2016.</p><p>But TMZ also pointed out that Eva and Jessica share a hairdresser; the famous Ken Paves apparently worked for both ladies back in the day. What about in the 2020s though?</p><p>It doesn't seem that the two have stepped out publicly in recent years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Really Happened Between Eva Longoria And Tony Parker?">What Really Happened Between Eva Longoria And Tony Parker?</a></span></p><p>In 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Longoria defended Simpson against criticism by Dallas Cowboys fans</a> (Jessica was dating quarterback Tony Romo at the time) who blamed the latter for the team losing a game. That seemed to be the last time Eva spoke about Jessica's life publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet the two have other connections; in 2015, documents went public about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lawsuit that involved Simpson and Longoria's dentist</a>. Of course, the dentist had a star-studded list of clients, but it's possible the two have run in the same social celeb circles since that fated music video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dmsOiecuopaCnop6ubq3NnWSjnaOotqStjKygpqijpLtustGinKeco2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-forgot-all-about-that-time-eva-longoria-was-in-jessica-simpson-s-music-video.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-find-nudes-on-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-find-nudes-on-instagram.html>How to find nudes on instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bethany-hamilton-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Bethany Hamilton Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bethany-hamilton-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
