As true as it is, these celebrities were often not sure they would <a href=#>make it big in the music industry</a>. They got degrees in architecture or the English language and had backup jobs planned for themselves.</p><p>These are the jobs that some of your favorite singers say they'd have if they hadn't become famous.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber>Justin Bieber</h2><p>The Canadian British singer and pop star Justin Bieber is loved for his pop songs. He became famous when he was a teenager and has had a long-lasting career in the music industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber's Million-Dollar Homes</a></span></p><p>However, if Bieber had not made it big in the music industry, he would probably have strived towards becoming an astronaut, as indicated in a 2012 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</h2><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift has had a long-lasting career in the music industry</a>, and she is still one of the best music-producing artists. The lengthy career of the singer in itself is proof of her talent.</p><p>However, if Taylor had not been famous as a singer, the pop star says she would probably be a designer or, as she had mentioned in past interviews, even a detective.</p><h2 id=britney-spears>Britney Spears</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney Spears has had a lot of ups and downs in her music career. However, she has always emerged stronger and more glorious than before.</p><p>It is probably difficult for her fans to imagine her in any other profession, given the amazing talent as a pop star she holds. Britney once expressed the wish of being a history teacher if her career had not taken off.</p><h2 id=zayn-malik>Zayn Malik</h2><p><a href=#>Zayn Malik is a musician who rose to fame very quickly</a>. Some of his notable performances include Dusk Till Dawn, I Don't Wanna Live Forever, and Pillow Talk.</p><p>While wondering what Malik would have opted for, he told the V Man mag that he would specialize in English if he did not become successful in the music industry and would probably become an English lecturer after completing university education.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran>Ed Sheeran</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Sheeran is a favorite among the young and the old. He has composed brilliant music, and it is next to impossible to imagine him in any other profession.</p><p>Ed Sheeran revealed in a show called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Today' in 2014</a> that he would be in a different profession if he had not become famous as a singer and songwriter. He said he would be working in a supermarket because he had not finished his college education.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus>Miley Cyrus</h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> became a star when she was a child performer. She became famous as Hannah Montana and later dropped one hit album after another.</p><p>It pretty much seems that Miley Cyrus was born to be a singer. But she expressed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Record</a> the desire to have a profession in photography. She even considered attending an art school in London to hone this talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles>Harry Styles</h2><p>Harry Styles is an American singer who became famous as a teenage artist at the age of 16. Styles has received popularity with the release of new music and the outspoken support for the Queer community.</p><p>However, Harry was well decided upon what he would have done if the boy band One Direction had not become a successful venture. He would become a psychotherapist.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas>Joe Jonas</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Joe Jonas</a> is one of the famous three members of the pop-rock band called Jonas Brothers. He is a famous American songwriter and singer who recently married the favorite Game of Thrones star, Sofie Turner.</p><p>Joe has amazing cooking skills. He plans to take on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a job as a restauranteur </a>when he retires from the music industry.</p><h2 id=ice-cube>Ice Cube</h2><p>Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson) is more than an American rap star. He has found success as an actor and a filmmaker.</p><p>Jackson is most recognized for his brilliant rap music content. But the pop star would have taken up something in the field of architecture if he had not become famous as a musician. He already has a degree in architectural drafting, and with some more training, he could very well turn into a professional.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=weird-al-yankovic>"Weird Al" Yankovic</h2><p>"Weird Al" Yankovic has carved a unique space for himself in <a href=#>the music industry</a>. He is known for composing and performing critically acclaimed parodies of blockbuster music productions.</p><p>Weird Al got himself a college education and a degree in architecture. He aimed to become qualified enough for the job of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cartoonist for Mad Magazine</a>.</p><p>These facts might, at first, come as a surprise to the fans of these celebrity musicians. But it only makes them more versatile and epic.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Jobs That Actors Say They'd Have, If They Hadn't Become Famous</a></span></p><p>Source - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranker</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popsugar</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fpq3LZqGomqNiwKq6xp6prGWnpMKtsIyhmK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-jobs-that-singers-say-they-d-have-if-they-hadn-t-become-famous.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bitnation-blog-com-top-bitnation-blogs-and-websites.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bitnation-blog-com-top-bitnation-blogs-and-websites.html>BitNation-Blog.com Top BitNation Blogs and Websites</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./woody-harrelson-parents-meet-charles-harrelson-and-diane-lou-oswald.html>Woody Harrelson Parents: Meet Charles Harrelson and Diane Lou Oswald</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./woody-harrelson-parents-meet-charles-harrelson-and-diane-lou-oswald.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
