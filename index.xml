It’s the one that I’ve tried to write over and over again
I’m awake in the infinite cold
But you sing to be over and over and over again
So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours, I pray
To be only yours I know now…
You’re my only hope
Sing to me the song of the stars</description></item><item><title>Remember Criss Angel?
