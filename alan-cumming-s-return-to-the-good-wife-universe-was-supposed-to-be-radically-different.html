However, getting Alan to come back was an arduous process. After all, his character didn't reappear until the sixth season of The Good Fight. Specifically, in a fabulous curse-word-filled shocker in the second episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This had been a long time coming," Alan said to Vulture. "There had been a lot of negotiations about money and blah, blah, blah and me feeling it’s important to understand your worth and expect to get paid what you got paid the last time you played this character."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Alan Cumming's Brutally Honest Feelings About Being In The James Bond Movie, GoldenEye</a></span></p><p>Of course, this <a href=#>wasn't the first time Alan has turned down a coveted role over a salary dispute</a>. But with The Good Fight, the problem was far more personal.</p><p>This issue was built on strife behind the scenes at CBS' The Good Wife. According to Vulture, Alan has claimed that he and Julianna Margulies weren't paid enough for their original roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They paid the rate. They coughed up," Alan said. "It was a win-win situation.</p><h2 id=alan-cumming-39-s-return-as-eli-gold-was-almost-very-very-different>Alan Cumming's Return As Eli Gold Was Almost Very, Very Different</h2><p>After the financial and logistical issues were worked out, Alan claimed that he was excited to see what the Kings had in store for Eli.</p><p>"The thing that excited me was they were going to kill me off initially! I thought that would be a great thing to do. So I shot the first episode, and then I got COVID during the filming of it, and then there was a gap, and then right before I was about to start the second one, they went, 'Oh, Alan, we can’t kill you. The studio won’t let us, and one of the producers cried when they read it.' So then I didn’t die. And I was so looking forward to dying!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Julianna Margulies Was About To Get Paid Like A 'Guest-Star' For 'The Good Fight'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Alan is unsure of the precise details of his character's death, he believed it was supposed to be instead of offing Frank Landau at the fundraiser.</p><p>"I think so, or it might have happened in the court. I can’t remember, but he was going to go!" Alan said to Vulture when he was asked about it.</p><p>"But then Frank went instead, and I felt terrible for Mike, the actor, for him to be collateral damage, but when I heard this was the final season, I didn’t feel so bad. He wouldn’t be able to come back anyway."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things You Didn't Know About The Good Wife</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alan continued by saying, "So what ended up happening was actually so much more exciting to play than just, you know, getting shot. Initially, I was disappointed that I didn’t die, but then I loved my Jackie O moment." So what ended up happening was actually so much more exciting to play than just, you know, getting shot.

And he seems to do so fondly. He has been asked about his experience on the show numerous times and without failure, Alan always praises it.</p><p>But does he have a favorite moment?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There’s lots of hilarious, histrionic ones like when he’s trying to strangle Frank Landau or when he chokes. But I think it’s more of the tender things that stuck with me," Alan admitted to Vulture.</p><p>"With Sarah or when America Ferrera was in it and there was a near-relationship that didn’t quite work out. I loved the scene when he told Alicia he deleted the voicemail and she threw all the plates at him. I loved that scene. It’s funny: Something comes into your life that you don’t really understand or don’t know what to do with — I just thought, What? — but it lasts so long and it has such a big impact on your life. I love Eli, and it’s been such an amazing thing to do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpZmeYrC2ucyipaCrXam1pnnGqKadZZaetKnAjKycmqufo3q0tddmm56ZpJ18</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falan-cumming-s-return-to-the-good-wife-universe-was-supposed-to-be-radically-different.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cariella-smith.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cariella-smith.html>Cariella Smith</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./philip-mudd-wikipedia-wife-and-family-facts-on-cnn-pundit.html>Philip Mudd Wikipedia, Wife, And Family: Facts On CNN Pundit</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./philip-mudd-wikipedia-wife-and-family-facts-on-cnn-pundit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
