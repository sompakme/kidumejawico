His career did not follow the same trajectory as others, DJ was thrust into the Hollywood spotlight instantly thanks to his fame in sports entertainment.

The characters related to one another a bit awkwardly. And the dialogue needed to be pared down.

The Rock turned up for the shoot, but <a href=#>let's just say he wasn't in his finest form</a>. Despite his condition, he pushed through and still put forward one heck of an effort.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He flew into Morocco on Wednesday. On Thursday, he had hair and makeup and wardrobe. And I shot him on Friday. I only shot him for one day. I had one day with him, because, on Saturday morning, he had to fly from the Sahara desert to Detroit for a big wrestling deal. He arrives on the set Friday morning and Dwayne had really bad food poisoning and heat stroke."</p><p>''It was probably 110, 112 degrees, and everybody’s in shorts and tank tops, and he would be covered in blankets, just shivering. And he is such a trooper. I will always love him, because I’m like, ‘Dwayne, we’ve only got one day! I can’t put it off! We can’t wait for you to get well!’ He goes, just get the camera rolling, and as soon as I hear ‘Background’ I’ll jump up.’ And that’s what he did. We did, ‘…and background!’ All the extras start going and I go, ‘Action!’ and Dwayne, he threw off the blankets and charged forward. And we just went all day. That guy gutted it out, because he was just a mess.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet another reason as to why Dwayne was worth every penny, even back then when he wasn't as established.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Food Poisoning And Heatstroke Didn't Stop Dwayne Johnson From Filming This 2001 Movie Scene</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsJmpo7Juts6hpaynnmLAorjAq7Bmn6Weu6%2Bx0qxksKeiobFuvsScpqucXaLCrrnYZqmerKWnu7R7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdwayne-johnson-s-film-debut-salary-broke-a-guinness-world-record.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fans-demand-to-know-what-happened-to-carrie-underwood-s-face-after-her-looks-cause-confusion.html>Fans Demand To Know What Happened To Carrie Underwoods Face After Her Looks Cause Confusion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./doctor-mike-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-career-net-worth-affair-dating-girlfriend-dr.html>Doctor Mike Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Career, Net Worth, Affair, Dating, Girlfriend, Dr.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./doctor-mike-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-career-net-worth-affair-dating-girlfriend-dr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
