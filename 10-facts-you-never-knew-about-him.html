They have gone way past Stern’s expiration date.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Married A Non-Famous Person&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=his-video-game-addiction-threatened-his-marriage>HIS VIDEO GAME ADDICTION THREATENED HIS MARRIAGE</h2><p>Freddie put his <a href=#>marriage</a> on the edge with his video game obsession. His wife stated that he was addicted to <a href=#>World&nbsp;of Warcraft</a>&nbsp;so much that it was becoming a problem. Gellar went in search of a solution online and ended up joining a support group called Widows of Warcraft.</p><p>It turned out she was not the only person who had lost her husband to the game, there was a ton of other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">widows</a>. Freddie was lucky to have a loving wife to help him out of the addiction.</p><h2 id=his-wedding-was-almost-a-disaster>HIS WEDDING WAS ALMOST A DISASTER</h2><p>The Hollywood stars' wedding was almost compromised by a big natural disaster. The pair tied the knot in 2002 in Mexico the day after a hurricane. On the day before the wedding, Hurricane Hernan forced them to move their outdoor ceremony inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the event, an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earthquake</a> hit the area while the guests were on their way home. The wedding was, however, a great success with the bride and guests having the time of their lives. With everyone gone, the newlyweds even stayed in Mexico for a while for their honeymoon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Celebrity Weddings</a></span></p><h2 id=he-only-drinks-on-date-nights>HE ONLY DRINKS ON DATE NIGHTS</h2><p>Freddy revealed the secret to staying in good shape saying that he does <a href=#>not drink</a> at all. Prinze never touches any <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alcohol</a>. He occasionally has a glass of sake when he is out on date night with the love of his life, Gellar.</p><p>The two have made it a tradition to go for date nights and have sushi with Japanese rice wine every once in a while. Prinze’s secret to a happy marriage is equalizing the time invested in your career to the time you spend with family.</p><h2 id=he-has-a-cookbook>HE HAS A COOKBOOK</h2><p>At the start of their relationship, Prinze and Gellar bonded over their love for food and cooking. They often cook together and make it a family activity by letting their children help in the kitchen.

The book includes many of his recipes, with his mother’s signature tomato soup, and speaks a lot of his Puerto Rican heritage and Mexican upbringing.</p><h2 id=prinze-has-never-watched-buffy>PRINZE HAS NEVER WATCHED BUFFY</h2><p>Freddie's most jaw-dropping revelation was not having watched <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>&nbsp;despite Buffy being his biggest fan. Considering Gellar starred on the show for seven years including the time they started dating, it comes as a very disappointing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confession</a>&nbsp;for fans.</p><p>He says, at his age, he was definitely not part of the show’s demographic. He was, however, on the set severally visiting his then-girlfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gellar</a>. Later on, she had him get a taste of it by making him watch two episodes of the show one being the musical episode.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-martial-artist-with-a-black-belt>HE IS A MARTIAL ARTIST WITH A BLACK BELT</h2><p>Having been introduced into martial arts by his godfather at the age of three, he developed a liking for the art and holds a blue belt in Jiujitsu.

He was downcast and troubled for being the son of a Freddie Prinze, a comedian, and actor who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p>His mother moved with him to Albuquerque in search of a more peaceful life when he was four but instead, he became a subject of bullying for his queerness. His lack of a father figure left a deep void in his heart as no one talked to him about his father’s death until he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">older</a>.</p><h2 id=he-was-involved-in-illegal-gambling>HE WAS INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL GAMBLING</h2><p>Before his first acting gig, Prinze was making it big in an illegal business. The first job he got at a restaurant involved illegal gambling.

He, however, quit illegal businesses from then on and simply sticks to video games and martial arts. He made an excellent decision as he would have missed out on all the fame and multiple awards.</p><h2 id=he-went-bald-after-scooby-doo>HE WENT BALD AFTER SCOOBY-DOO</h2><p>Being a big fan of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooby-doo</a>, Prinze felt that the film was not fit to be a representation of the original cartoon. While it was a great opportunity for him to star alongside his wife on the animated franchise, he initially turned down the role. During the filming, he had to die his hair blonde every week causing a lot of damage&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">forcing</a> him to shave bald afterward.</p><p>The movie turned out to be a success at the box office although Freddie revealed that he did not enjoy himself much in the filming. He has since retired from acting to focus more on his hobbies and family.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Facts You Never Knew About Sarah Michelle Gellar&nbsp;</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlqeypbDInmSpqpmjx6Z5yatkn5mTqcBuusSvnKtlm6OyuHnAm6aurF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-facts-you-never-knew-about-him.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-of-the-worst-nautical-disasters.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-of-the-worst-nautical-disasters.html>15 Of The Worst Nautical Disasters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./actor-ray-buffer-accused-of-stealing-comics-store-says-it-s-on-video.html>Actor Ray Buffer Accused of Stealing Comics, Store Says It's on Video</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./actor-ray-buffer-accused-of-stealing-comics-store-says-it-s-on-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
