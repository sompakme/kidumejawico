Emily Maynard, the show’s star, wasn’t just looking for a husband; she also wanted a man who could be a father to her young daughter.</p><p>Although Bukowski made it to the Hometown Dates section of the season, Emily eventually agreed to let him go after visiting his family in Chicago. Chris’ second stint on The Bachelorette was cut short because he was never an official contestant on Andi Dorfman’s season.</p><p>He arrived at the mansion and pleaded with the producers to let him meet Andi, but she refused, and he was sent off.
