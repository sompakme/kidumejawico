After all, kids all over the world adore Gad’s work voicing Olaf from the Frozen franchise so much that it is hard to overstate how happy the character makes them. As a result, <a href=#>whenever it is announced that Gad is set to voice Olaf in a new Disney project</a>, there are legions of children who rejoice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given everything that he has accomplished since he began voicing Olaf, some people have forgotten that <a href=#>Josh Gad was already a busy actor before he starred in Frozen</a>. Amazingly enough, however, Gad had a strange experience while he was performing one night early in his career that has clearly stuck with him ever since. While that sounds remarkable enough, the event is all the more amazing since it included one of the stars of the show Entourage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Idina Menzel Before Voicing Elsa In 'Frozen'?</a></span></p><h2 id=one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other>One Of These Things Is Not Like The Other</h2><p>In recent years, there have been more and more people who’ve come to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">see Josh Gad as a Disney legend</a>. After all, Gad played a pivotal role in the Frozen franchise’s overwhelming popularity as a lot of kids consider Olaf to be their favorite Disney character. Since it seems likely that Gad will always be best known as the guy who voices Olaf, it makes sense that a lot of people perceive the actor as being somewhat innocent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a wide array of websites that publish quotes that different celebrities are supposed to have said, Josh Gad has said that he has a more mature sense of humor than his fans may assume. In real life, Josh is a different kind of lovable idiot. In real life, he’s a much filthier idiot. He has a dirty sense of humor” – Josh Gad. Whether or not it can be proven that Gad actually said those words, during the actor’s public interviews, he comes across like a total sweetheart. On the other end of the spectrum, most people have a very different perception of the show Entourage. After all, a lot of people consider Entourage to be a prime example of toxic masculinity in television so it is surprising that someone associated with the show had a profound impact on Gad.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>HBO’s ‘Entourage’ Almost Had A Dark Ending</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-strange-experience>A Strange Experience</h2><p>Long before Frozen made Josh Gad a household name, the talented actor had his first brush with fame when he joined the original Broadway cast of the play “The Book of Mormon”. Considering how popular “The Book of Mormon” has been, it makes sense that Gad has told a lot of stories his experiences working on it since fans want to know everything they can about the play.</p><p>Given that Josh Gad took to the stage to star in “The Book of Mormon” night after night, you would think that his memories of all of those performances would blend into one another. As it turns out, however, something that happened one night during a “The Book of Mormon” performance has seemingly haunted Gad ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During at least two interviews, Josh Gad revealed that during a “The Book of Mormon” performance, he noticed one of the people who starred in Entourage being extremely rude. While that is bad enough, Gad was so upset by the Entourage star’s conduct that he forgot all of the words to a song in front of a crowd of hundreds of people, During an appearance on The Off Camera Show, Gad called that night as the worst of his life. During a different interview for The Chicago Tribune, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gad described how horrified he was that night in great detail</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Entourage: Everything The Cast Has Been Up To Since The Finale</a></span></p><p>“So, there was one particular night in which one of our esteemed audience members was very poorly behaved and was not necessarily abiding by the rules of the theatergoing experience and I was just irked. I’m keeping this person anonymous, but they were on Entourage.” “But this person was checking their phone, just talking and not really listening. And what upset me was that they were in the first three rows. So, I’m like, you can do all that stuff, but if you’re in my eye line? Show me the same respect I would show you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I don’t consider myself to be a great improviser, but I definitely know how to improv and I’ve used it to get out of many pickles and it’s something that I call upon. On this particular night, improv was not available to me because the human ability to speak words was not available to me.”</p><p>From there, Gad went on to describe a co-star, the stage manager, and the orchestra conductor all trying to feed him the first line of the song. Amazingly enough, Gad says that he was so upset at that moment that his ears were ringing and he couldn’t hear any of them. Finally, Gad says he forced another co-star to feed him the line a fourth time even though it made no sense for her character to know what he was supposed to sing. Given how mortifying all of that sounds and the fact that the experience has clearly stuck with Gad, it would have made sense if he gave up on acting following that performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Josh Gad’s 10 Most Relatable Tweets</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmmKdllaPBsMHRmp6eZaOprrN5wKWkqKukYr%2B2tc2em2ain6i1brPAnapmm5Gnsqa%2BjJumqKNdpLNuuc6rpKimXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-an-entourage-star-almost-ruined-josh-gad-s-career.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joshua-dobbs-age-height-parents-college-iq-degree-wife-children-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joshua-dobbs-age-height-parents-college-iq-degree-wife-children-instagram.html>Joshua Dobbs Age, Height, Parents, College, IQ, Degree, Wife, Children, Instagram</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dominique-bisson.html>Dominique Bisson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dominique-bisson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
