In 2005, <a href=#>the Wild Things star</a> filed for divorce from her husband of three years due to "irreconcilable differences." At the time, she was six months pregnant with <a href=#>their second child, Lola Rose Sheen</a> — born a year after <a href=#>her elder sister, Sami Sheen</a> who recently <a href=#>made her parents clash after joining the adult content subscription platform, OnlyFans</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's a timeline of Denise and Charlie's rocky relationship, from their troubled marriage to their messy divorce and <a href=#>divided co-parenting relationship</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Denise Richards And Brandi Glanville's Relationship Is A Total Mess</a></span></p><h2 id=denise-richards-amp-charlie-sheen-s-troubled-marriage>Denise Richards & Charlie Sheen's Troubled Marriage</h2><p>In a 2020 episode of <strong><a href=#>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a></strong>, Denise clarified some misconceptions about her marriage to Charlie. "A lot of people have an impression of me being wild and crazy," she explained during the show.</p><p>"But Charlie was sober when we got married so we were not this swinging couple like people might assume. We weren't." She added that their marriage started to sour before she even gave birth to their second daughter. "When I got pregnant with Lola, things started to change rapidly," said the reality star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was a very dark time. Very toxic. And I filed for divorce when I was six months pregnant with her," Denise continued. "I always did whatever I could to hide Charlie's behavior. How do you tell kids what's really going on? I would say, 'Dad had to go work but he loves you so much. He wants to be here for you girls.'" In a previous episode, the actress also expressed her concerns about the impact of <a href=#>Charlie's public scandals</a> on their children.</p><p>"There's a lot that the kids don't know about their dad, and I want to keep it that way," the RHOBH star said of <a href=#>her ex's past involving drugs and women</a>. "Even though he's Charlie Sheen, that is still, to them, their dad. I never talk badly about him and I want him to be part of their lives because I met a lot of the women that Charlie entertained and a lot of them had father-daughter issues. And I do not want that to be our girls."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Corey Haim's Mother Said About The Allegations About Charlie Sheen</a></span></p><h2 id=denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen-s-ugly-divorce>Denise Richards And Charlie Sheen's Ugly Divorce</h2><p>After filing for divorce, Denise did multiple interviews where she made disturbing claims about Charlie. "Obviously, what has taken place is vile, is unconscionable, is without merit, is a transparent and immature smear campaign," the actor said of his ex's press attacks. "She's claiming certain things. It's baseless."</p><p>A month later, the two seemingly made a truce to settle their divorce. "Denise and Charlie are working with the courts to privately resolve their differences regarding their children," they said in a joint statement. "They hope to resolve this matter outside the public forum and will both continue to make every effort in this regard." Still, lawyers of both parties agreed to extend Denise's restraining order against Charlie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple didn't really disclose their settlement to the public. But it was reported that <a href=#>Charlie agreed to pay Denise $80,000 in child support</a>. However, in 2021, news broke that Charlie was done with it. <a href=#>The Two and a Half Men alum</a> apparently filed a request to change his child support arrangement back in December 2019. However, Denise claimed that he had stopped paying child support even before that.</p><p>"He hasn’t paid Denise in at least four years. No child support. He owes her. Also Lola lives with Denise. When she is filming she is with her dad and sister," said an insider at the time. "She didn't have a falling out with her daughters and she cares about them deeply. But Charlie condones behavior that he shouldn't and sets no rules. Lola doesn't live there permanently. Sami prefers no rules."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Was David Schwimmer's Storyline With Denise Richards His Worst Moment On Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=denise-richards-and-charlie-sheen-s-relationship-now>Denise Richards And Charlie Sheen's Relationship Now</h2><p>These days, Denise and Charlie are still at odds with each other. Recently, <a href=#>the actress joined her daughter Sami on OnlyFans</a>, causing Charlie to slam her parenting. Speaking to E! News, the Hot Shots star said that he does "not condone" his daughter's decision to join the platform.</p><p>"But since I'm unable to prevent it, I urged her to keep it classy, creative and not sacrifice her integrity," he said. "She is 18 years old now and living with her mother. This did not occur under my roof."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Denise responded by telling People that Sami's choice "wasn't based on whose house she lives in" and that "all I can do as a parent is guide her and trust her judgment, but she makes her own choices."</p><p>A month before that, Denise told Jeff Lewis on his SiriusXM Show that she actually had a complicated relationship with her firstborn. "Honestly, I have a strained relationship with her," she confessed. "It's very difficult. I know we'll get back to where we were eventually, but right now, it is strained."</p><p>She added that she wanted Sami to move back in with her but that it's tough raising teens anyway. "Obviously I would love for her to live with me. She lived with me all these years," she admitted. "But I think it's very difficult raising teenagers now and especially in Los Angeles when there's access to everything. We didn't grow up with Postmates and Uber where you have everything that you want. There are certain rules and I enforce them. And [at Charlie's], there's different rules at that house, and that's okay."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe This 'Two And A Half Men' Star Is Older Than Charlie Sheen</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqaZqLJuvsicn5qqlKh6orrDZpqhmaKhtqZ50qGcnqZdmba3u9GcnGarlanBrbHMnqWtZZSawaK1y6xm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-denise-richards-let-charlie-sheen-off-easy-during-their-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katt-williams-gets-placed-in-a-headlock-by-a-7th-grader-during-a-fight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katt-williams-gets-placed-in-a-headlock-by-a-7th-grader-during-a-fight.html>Katt Williams Gets Placed In A Headlock By A 7th Grader During A Fight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./danny-griffin-girlfriend-who-is-danny-griffin-girlfriend-now.html>Danny Griffin Girlfriend: Who is Danny Griffin Girlfriend Now?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./danny-griffin-girlfriend-who-is-danny-griffin-girlfriend-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
