The kids in the basement went through real-world issues and zany hijinks, while upstairs the parents also had full lives. It's a classic for a reason. No matter how many times we've watched it, this sitcom will always be a fun one to go back to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, there were a lot of weird things that went down in Point Place, Wisconsin, and a lot of them involved Donna and Eric's on-again, off-again relationship.

Whenever they get especially weird or dysfunctional, Donna acts out - and most of the time, this involves getting into trouble with Eric. Eric knows she uses him to get back at her parents and even jokes about it.</p><h2 id=eric-pantses-donna-in-front-of-all-their-male-friends-then-laughs-at-her-choice-of-underwear><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Eric Pantses Donna In Front Of All Their Male Friends, Then Laughs At Her Choice Of Underwear</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eric-Pantses-Donna-That-70s-Show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 3, Episode 15: "Donna's Panties." During a basketball game in the driveway with their friends, Eric pulls down Donna's pants when she goes for a slam dunk and then joins in with their friends when they laugh at her granny panties. It's meant as a harmless prank, but Donna is understandably furious. By Season 3, she isn't just "one of the guys" anymore - she's Eric's girlfriend.</p><h2 id=hyde-and-kelso-bully-eric-for-being-a-virgin><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Hyde And Kelso Bully Eric For Being A Virgin</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hyde-and-Kelso-yell-at-Eric-on-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>Halfway through Season 2, Donna surprises Eric by climbing up to his bedroom window in the middle of the night and sleeping with him in his bed. They're both very happy with how the night went, until Hyde and Kelso hear about it and berate Eric for not trying to have sex with Donna. Naturally, the next time Donna climbs through his window, they don't have as good a time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eric-loves-cake><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Eric Loves...

When she does, it takes Eric completely by surprise, and instead of telling her he loves her too, he blurts out that he loves cake.

Eric is more in line with the times, still making sexist comments about his sister and female friends and expecting Donna to defer to him in their relationship. Why she puts up with it is anyone's guess.</p><h2 id=eric-tries-to-pressure-donna-into-committing-with-a-promise-ring-then-dumps-her-when-she-says-she-s-not-ready><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Eric Tries To Pressure Donna Into Committing With A Promise Ring, Then Dumps Her When She Says She's Not Ready</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Eric-and-Donna-Ring-That-70s-Show.jpg><p>In Season 3, Eric and Kelso go shopping for promise rings for their girlfriends. Eric thinks Donna will be thrilled with the gift, but she's hesitant such a big commitment at such a young age. Eric feels slighted and makes her choose: him and the ring, or break up.
