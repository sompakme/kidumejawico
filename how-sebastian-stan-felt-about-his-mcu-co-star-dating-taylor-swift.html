And back in 2016, they did.. In quite a memorable way, might we add.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As some may recall, Loki himself, Tom Hiddleston, got into a bit of mischief with the statuesque blond singer. The two were all hot and bothered with one another for less than a year. Still, Tom was clearly head-over-heels for Taylor, and that's something he should've wanted to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">keep private from us</a>. But he didn't. He basically screamed out his infatuation to the world... After all, the dude wore an "I-Heart-Taylor Swift" tank top while splashing around in the water with her.</p><p>It was a weird moment. Not all of Tom's fans approved... nor did all of his MCU co-stars...</p><p>Back in 2018, Sebastian Stan (Aka Bucky Barnes, The Winter Soldier) had some pretty blunt things to say about how he felt Tom was making a mistake getting involved with Taylor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Best Taylor Swift Songs (According To YouTube Views)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sebastian-s-reaction-to-the-hiddleswift-phenomenon-was-varied-and-mostly-negative>Sebastian's Reaction To The HiddleSwift Phenomenon Was Varied... And Mostly Negative</h2><p>The whole thing went down <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>. Sebastian was on the show with The Matrix 4 star Priyanka Chopra and were caught up in Andy's 'After Show' segment where the audience phones in with questions.</p><p>The first few questions were easy enough. They had to do with The Winter Soldier's fate after Avengers: Infinity War, Priyanka's least favorite episodes of Quantico, and how weddings can be fun if they aren't your own. Priyanka also teased Sebastian for being really cagey and quiet about his romantic life. Clearly, he feels that a bit of mystery is important, especially in terms of his personal life. This value clearly dictated Sebastian's answer to the next question...</p><p>"I was wondering, what was your reaction to your Avengers' co-star Tom Hiddleston dating Taylor Swift and wearing the I-Heart-Taylor Swift tank top?" a caller named Patty asked of Sebastian Stan.</p><p>"It's an amazing question," Sebastian said with a large, somewhat shell-shocked, grin on his face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then went on to say that his reaction was varied... and not in a good way.</p><p>"[his reaction] was one of awe and extreme concern."</p><p>At this point, both Andy Cohen and Priyanka Chopra were laughing uncomfortably.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Rundown: Sebastian Stan Talks Avengers 5</a></span></p><p>Sebastian added that he was somewhat obsessed with the whole relationship that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Cosmopolitan</a>, may have started before Taylor had broken up with famed DJ and recording artist Calvin Harris.</p><p>"[his reaction was one of] obsession and, at the same time.... [laughing] ... I know... I want the word... Um, I don't know, I was really worried for... mainly for him..."</p><p>"Yeah," Andy Cohen agreed. "He went in hard there."</p><p>"Yeah," Sebastian replied. "But you know love is quick and hard."</p><p>"Especially love with a popstar," Andy said before asking Sebastian if he confronted Tom about the relationship, or even warned him not to go into it in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No, I didn't. I didn't. I actually forgot about that incident."</p><p>"I think you need to talk about it with him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hiddleston Is Still Single, And 14 Other Surprising Facts About Loki</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-and-taylor-s-relationship-wasn-t-meant-to-be-and-it-s-probably-for-the-best>Tom And Taylor's Relationship Wasn't Meant To Be... And It's Probably For The Best</h2><p>Regardless of Sebastian's thoughts about his Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star getting romantically tangled up with Taylor Swift, it happened. There's no changing that. But there's also no changing the fact that the two went hot and heavy and then ended things as quickly as they began.</p><p>According to Cosmopolitan, the two may have first flirted while at a May 2016 dinner at Anna Wintour's home. Shortly after, Tom and Taylor were spotted dancing together at the MET Gala... This is while Taylor was still involved with Calvin Harris... Yeah... that doesn't look so good on the "You Belong With Me" singer, does it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About a month later, Taylor and Calvin ended things. Two weeks later, Taylor and Tom were spotted making out on a beach near her Rhode Island mansion. This is when Swifties (Taylor's fans) absolutely lost it... as did Calvin, who promptly 'unfollowed' Taylor on Instagram.</p><p>Less than two weeks after that, Tom introduced Taylor to his mother in England... Yeah, seriously... no wonder Sebastian was concerned about all of this...</p><p>They met a the beginning of May... by the end of June, he was introducing her to his mother... And she was still fresh from breaking up with a longterm boyfriend...</p><p>The couple did a bit of traveling after the matter and then, by July 4th, Tom was wearing his hideous "I-Heart-Taylor-Swift" shirt... in public no less.</p><p>By September of the same year... they ended things. Reports say that Tom was the one who called it quits after losing an Armani campaign deal because of Taylor and the fact that he wanted their relationship to be even more public than it already was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Something about all of this felt really off... So, it's understandable why Sebastian Stan felt the way he did.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Tom Hiddleston’s Movies And Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqLKjrdKtoJqmXajBorqMn5ylrF2Wr7DB02afoqtdorC2ecKoZKyskad6pa3ToqWgZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-sebastian-stan-felt-about-his-mcu-co-star-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-bert-convy-married-to-wife-or-dating-a-girlfriend-past-relationships.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-bert-convy-married-to-wife-or-dating-a-girlfriend-past-relationships.html>Is Bert Convy Married to Wife?
