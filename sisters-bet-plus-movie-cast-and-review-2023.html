It is 1 minute and thirty-six minutes long.</p><p>The trailer begins with three masked females entering a house at night with a gun in their hands. The first question they ask the house owner is, where is the money?</p><p>The trailer then shows a top view of Los Angeles, California and immediately after that, we hear Diamond talking to E saying that her grandmother is sick.</p><p>After that, we are drawn to the hospital scene, where the three sisters are taking updates on their grandmother, to which Dr. Thomas replies in a low voice.</p><figure></figure><p>She continues by saying that after running a blood test on Pat, they have found signs of cancer, and have no health insurance.</p><p>Next, we see Diamond with E. It seems like she visited him for money but just like E, we viewers are shocked to see, her asking for some guns.</p><p>Similarly, Kevin tells the girls that there is a way to get Pat out of such a situation, an easy way to make money.</p><p>He tells her that they can possibly make about 100 million dollars.</p><p>It seems like the girls agree to get themselves involve in the process of earning fast cash.</p><p>The job might be to loot a person at gunpoint by entering their house at night.</p><p>Diamond is seen inside a car with Trae, possibly a member of the work the Sisters have indulged themselves into.</p><p>Trae threatens her for not picking up the call. Next, we see a frustrated Diamond, who seemed to be tired of waiting for a miracle to save her grandmother.</p><p>Tara, on the other hand, seemed a little worried about getting involved in the secret job, that is considering her job as a police officer.</p><p>Tia reminds her that it is Grandma we are fighting for.</p><p>The last 1 minute includes suspenseful track music with lots of new faces and stories.</p><p>Lastly, we can see a group hug of the sisters saying no one can break this family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuZqMGmvtJmmZ6sXaW5tr%2BMpqavoZVisKK%2F02aYp5xdp7K3tcSwZGtoYmh8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsisters-bet-plus-movie-cast-and-review-2023.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-10-least-expensive-products-by-hermes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-10-least-expensive-products-by-hermes.html>The 10 Least Expensive Products by Hermes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./priscilla-presley-and-riley-keough-remember-late-lisa-marie-presley.html>Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough Remember Late Lisa Marie Presley</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./priscilla-presley-and-riley-keough-remember-late-lisa-marie-presley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
