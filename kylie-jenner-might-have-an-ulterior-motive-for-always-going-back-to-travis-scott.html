In April 2017 they were spotted together at Coachella, and within less than one month, Travis Scott was reportedly telling his friends that they were a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their relationship, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott welcomed two children, Stormi and Aire Webster. The couple has often been seen together, but they have also had periods of being apart, even though they don't always publicize their splits or the reasoning behind them.</p><p>Their relationship is on/off, breaking up to focus on their individual careers and families, but also getting back together and announcing a pregnancy. It isn't a secret they didn't live together for most of their relationship and often showed having different interests.</p><p>Also, fans noticed a pattern; the 'one baby daddy' in the Kardashian-Jenner family. For these reasons, as well as Kylie Jenner's dream of being a young mom, many people think Kylie Jenner might have an ulterior motive for staying with Travis Scott, and isn't necessarily about love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-reportedly-split-shortly-after-they-had-their-second-child>Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott Reportedly Split Shortly After They Had Their Second Child</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kylie.jpg><p>When Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott announced that their son has been born, most fans thought that their on/off relationship can change to something more serious. That wasn't the case.</p><p>Within months since Aire Webster came into the world, Kylie Jenner reportedly dumped Travis Scott, shocking, once again, everyone with this decision.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking back on their relationship</a>, this wasn't the first time that they took a break. Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott broke up in October 2019 because they needed to focus on their individual careers and families.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Kylie Jenner Let Her Famous Sisters Use Her Private Jet?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their break, cheating rumors emerged from both sides but proved to be only rumors. Both Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott went to social media to stop any drama regarding their personal lives.</p><p>Shortly after, they got back together and welcomed a second child. Rumors of a wedding were emerging, but they quickly vanished when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner dumped Travis Scott months after Aire Webster was born</a>.</p><h2 id=fans-think-kylie-stayed-with-travis-for-one-reason>Fans Think Kylie Stayed With Travis For One Reason</h2><p>Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott's relationship was always unconventional since they didn't live together much, and focused on separate aspects of their lives. While some people appreciate their modern lifestyle, others don't understand why Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott get back together and have children, considering their interests seem different.</p><p>From being great at co-parenting, but not being consistently together, Kylie Jenner's relationship with her baby daddy has a <a href=#>similar pattern to the one of Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner And 7 Other Celebrities Who Welcomed Children At A Young Age</a></span></p><p>Also, each Kardashian-Jenner sister has one baby daddy, including Scott Disick, Kanye West, Tristan Thompson, and Travis Scott. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans debated these points</a> for some time, coming to the conclusion that Kylie Jenner might stay with Travis Scott because of the family's unspoken 'one baby daddy' rule.</p><p>Also, they think another reason might be that Kylie Jenner went to a psychic who told her she'll have two children, and Travis Scott was already the father of her first child. So, it made sense to have a second child with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-56.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, many fans actually think <a href=#>their relationship is fake</a> because there is a visible lack of chemistry between them. Some even claim that Travis Scott doesn't seem in love with Kylie Jenner, especially because of the cheating rumors.</p><p>Even more, Travis Scott mistook Kendall Jenner's tattoo as being on Kylie Jenner's body during an interview. These reasons, along with many others, confused fans about Kylie Jenner's reasons for staying with Travis Scott.</p><h2 id=does-kylie-jenner-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-staying-with-travis-scott>Does Kylie Jenner Have An Ulterior Motive For Staying With Travis Scott?</h2><p>It isn't a secret that Kylie Jenner wants a big family and <a href=#>loves being a young mom</a>. She enjoys cooking with Stormi or spoiling her children with lavish birthday parties, toys, designer clothing, or vacations. Kylie Jenner became a mom when she was about 20 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-55.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the years, she mentioned several times how exciting it is to be a young mom.

It seemed too complicated to break up, be in love for a few months, have a child, and then break up again.</p><p>Since fans theorize that each sister follows the apparently unspoken 'one baby daddy' rule, fans suspect Kylie Jenner had a similar plan in mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, it's unclear whether Kylie plans to continue trying to have more kids with Travis, if they'll stay broken up for good, or if Kylie even wants more kids at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoMattcRmoZ6mnpq%2Fbr%2FTmrCsZaeewal506uYr6GjYsCku9OtZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkylie-jenner-might-have-an-ulterior-motive-for-always-going-back-to-travis-scott.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-edwards-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-edwards-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Michael Edwards Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kathy-garver-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Kathy Garvers Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kathy-garver-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
