Curly hair needs extra love and care because it tends to be drier than other hair textures because natural oils produced by the scalp have a harder time making their way down the curly strands. What makes things worse is when those with curly hair use shampoos that are made with sulfates. In this article, we will first explore what sulfates are and why they are so damaging to curly hair. Then, we will show you the best sulfate-free shampoos to use on your curly hair.</p><h2>What are Sulfates?</h2><p>Sulfates are a form of salt widely known for their effectiveness in removing oils and dirt from the hair. The American hair care industry used sulfates as a detergent in shampoos for a long time, until it was proven that this chemical compound is actually very harmful to the hair. Now, more and more companies are steering towards eliminating sulfates from their products and replacing them with gentler, plant-based detergents.</p><h2>Why Should You Avoid Sulfates for Curly Hair?</h2><p>So, what is so harmful about sulfates? Why are so many hair care companies steering clear of this ingredient? Well, the answer is that they cause damage in the following ways:</p><h3>They Strip Natural Oils</h3><p>As we previously stated, curly hair is already naturally drier in the majority of cases. The oils found on the scalp do not travel down the hair as easily as they do for wavy or even straight hair. Sulfates destroy oils and when applied to curly hair, already dry on its own, they make matters even worse. This can cause curly locks to appear frazzled, frizzy, brittle, and dry. It can also lead to hair loss over time.</p><h3>They Irritate the Scalp</h3><p>Sulfates are very drying and will lead to irritation of the scalp over time. They dry out the hair follicles and destroy the natural properties that produce those essential oils needed for a healthy scalp. As a result, you may end up with an itchy, irritated, or flaky scalp.</p><h3>Remove Color Faster</h3><p>Sulfates are a very harsh detergent. As a result, those who color their hair will notice their color fading quicker when they use a shampoo with sulfates in it.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Invigorating and Strengthening Shampoo by Blu Atlas</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Our top pick for the best sulfate-free shampoo for curly hair is by far the Shampoo by Blu Atlas. This shampoo is made with origin-sourced, vegan ingredients that are perfect for curly hair. With the help of these ingredients, your curly hair texture will be defined and you will look your best every single day.</p><p>One of the key ingredients in this shampoo is aloe vera, which is especially helpful for curly hair. Aloe vera is naturally moisturizing and will help hydrate and nourish the hair, infusing it with an irresistible softness and shine. It will help tame the frizz, soothe any irritations on your scalp, and promote fuller hair growth.</p><p>In addition to the aloe vera, this shampoo also contains jojoba oil, which is rich in vitamins, fatty acids, and antioxidants. Thanks to these nutrients, the hair will be doubly moisturized and repaired from any damage and split ends.</p><p>This shampoo also contains saw palmetto as one of its key ingredients, which is a great strengthening agent for the hair. Saw palmetto helps strengthen the hair follicles and reverse hair loss caused by the hormone DHT. Saw palmetto is paired perfectly with vegan biotin, which supports the structure and elasticity of the hair.</p><p>While many shampoos use sulfates to create that rich, lathering effect we all love in shampoos, Blu Atlas opted to use a coconut-derived surfactant. It creates that same soft, pillowy lather that removes all the impurities from the hair without stripping its natural oils.</p><p>Blu Atlas is an amazing skincare brand that uses natural, origin-sourced ingredients in its formulations. This shampoo contains only vegan ingredients that will strengthen, cleanse, and condition the hair. It doesn’t have any harsh chemicals like sulfates, parabens, or phthalates and is produced using the highest industry standards for clean, cruelty-free hair care products. With all of these wonderful benefits, it is easy to name this product the best sulfate-free shampoo for curly hair.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kérastase Bain Hydration Douceur Shampoo&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>Kérastase always had a lot to offer the hair, especially for those with curly and coily hair types. The Bain Hydration Douceur Shampoo is especially impressive and promising for those who wish to soften and enhance their curls.</p><p>One of the key ingredients in this shampoo is manuka honey, which has been traditionally used for a variety of medicinal purposes. However, it also has a unique ability to enhance the appearance and structure of each curl. Manuka honey is a natural humectant, which helps the hair retain its moisture longer. This is especially useful for those with curly hair as it tends to be dry and frizzy.</p><p>This shampoo also features ceramides, which aid the hair with additional strength, making it more resilient against damage caused by heat tools, chemical treatments, and other environmental factors. Ceramides also seal in the hair’s moisture and improve its elasticity. As a result, your curls will bounce and stretch without breaking.</p><p>There is a good dose of coconut in this shampoo, which is naturally moisturizing and nourishing. Coconut is full of fatty acids that help condition the hair and define its gorgeous locks. With this ingredient, your hair will appear healthier, shinier, and stronger.</p><p>This shampoo is so effective and beneficial for curly and coily hair that it earned itself an award from Women’s Health, and continues to gain popularity among hair stylists and general consumers as well. The premium-grade ingredients and highly nourishing approach to curly hair make this shampoo an unforgettable product.</p><p>The Bain Hydration Douceur Shampoo also features a warm and floral fragrance. It gives off its elegant touch of roses and inspires thoughts of peace and happiness. With its rich formulation and gentle fragrance, this shampoo is a unique and effective solution for those who have curly hair. Of course, it is free of sulfates, parabens, and all the other junk that would cause harm to gorgeous, curly locks.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sulfate Free Shampoo&nbsp;</a></h3><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>There’s nothing quite as nice and elegant as the Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sulfate-Free Shampoo. This shampoo is made in Japan with the highest quality ingredients that provide a special protective treatment for curly, color-treated hair.</p><p>This shampoo is made with Japan’s finest ingredients like musk rose oil.

The musk rose oil is also full of strengthening and protective properties that fight off damage caused by free radicals, pollutants, and UV radiation.</p><p>The Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sulfate-Free Shampoo also has Japanese goji berry extracts, which are rich in antioxidants. These antioxidants will further strengthen the hair, promoting healthy and thick hair growth. Goji berries are naturally moisturizing, which is very beneficial for curly hair that is often dry.</p><p>The other ingredients that make this shampoo especially effective for curly hair are glycerin and salicylic acid. Glycerin adds additional layers of moisture to the hair and helps lock it in for longer periods of time. Salicylic acid is helpful for removing the buildup of dead skin and products that prevent healthy and voluminous growth.</p><p>The fragrance of this shampoo is also very special, featuring the lovely mingling of goji berries and musky rose. The fragrance is alluring and grows in intensity as you lather the shampoo into your hair. It makes for a very pleasant and exhilarating aromatherapy session as you go about cleansing your hair.</p><p>Shu Uemura Color Lustre Sulfate-Free Shampoo is a premium product that is made without all the harmful additives.

It is so rich in moisturizing and conditioning properties that it will effectively help smooth out the hair and repair the damage caused by excess dryness and heat tools. As a result, your hair will be visibly improved, with far less frizz and breakage.</p><p>Argan oil is also super helpful for curly hair, as it also reduces frizz by hydrating and softening the hair.

This nutrition is particularly beneficial for those with curly hair. Thanks to this wonderful oil, your hair will be protected against heat damage and each curl will bounce with shine and an enhanced texture.</p><p>This shampoo comes with a built-in UV filter and protection against heat styling.

It can be temperamental sometimes and as such, it needs a carefully structured hair care routine that will ensure that it stays bouncy and beautiful. Below, we outline some of our best tips that will enhance the appearance and health of your curly hair.</p><h3>Pick a Good Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>Every hair care routine starts with a good shampoo and conditioner. Take the time to find a shampoo and conditioner that is free of sulfates, parabens, and other harmful ingredients that can destroy your natural curls. Pay close attention to the labels and make sure that the products you choose are designed for your hair type.</p><h3>Don’t Use Regular Hair Brushes</h3><p>Those traditional hair brushes that are closely packed with bristles are not the best for curly hair. They will tangle in your curls and tear at your hair. We recommend using a wide-tooth comb to brush out the knots and tangles from your curls. This is a gentler way of brushing your hair that will ensure your hair is healthy and free of breakage.</p><h3>Limit Hair Wash Days</h3><p>Unlike straight hair, curly hair thrives when its wash days are on a less frequent schedule. This allows those essential oils time to travel from the scalp and naturally nourish the rest of your hair. As a result, your hair won’t look as dry and won’t break as easily. Try to wash your hair every 2-3 days, depending on your activity levels throughout the day.</p><h3>Blow Dry with a Diffuser</h3><p>Blow dryers are often necessary but they put the hair in direct contact with the hair. We recommend using a diffuser attachment when drying your hair. This will keep the hot air from frying your ends and help dry the hair evenly.</p><h3>Consider Using a Satin Pillowcase</h3><p>Satin fabric is gentler on the hair and won’t cause as much friction as cotton fabrics. The less friction your hair gets during your sleep, the less breakage and frizz it will develop.</p><h3>Deep Condition Regularly</h3><p>Curly hair can benefit from regular deep conditioning treatments, as they can help restore moisture and elasticity to the hair. Hair masks made with avocado, macadamia nut, or argan oil are all good examples of deep conditioning treatments. Treat your hair to this nourishing treatment at least once a week for 20 minutes and you will see a big difference in the quality of your hair.</p><h3>Use a Heat Protectant</h3><p>When you blow dry or style your hair with hot tools, it is important to use a thermal heat protectant. This will prevent further breakage and frizz. Some heat protectants also shield the hair from UV rays, which are also very damaging and drying to the hair.</p><h3>Schedule Regular Hair Cuts</h3><p>Lastly, take the extra step of scheduling a maintenance hair trim every six to eight weeks. This will prevent split ends and help your curls look healthier and more defined.</p><p><i>Check out more of our picks and deals </i><a href=#><i>here</i></a><i>!</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2owq2ywK2cZp6imrJuv8eapKmnn6h6pMHRpbBmoJGev3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f8-best-sulfate-free-shampoos-for-curly-hair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./austin-james-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./austin-james-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Austin James Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-was-jennifer-dulos-husband-is-fotis-dulos-dead-what-happened-to-fotis-dulos.html>Who was Jennifer Dulos Husband?
