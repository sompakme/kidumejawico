Both John Travolta and <a href=#><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a> got their start decades ago and are still making news headlines as their careers and personal lives continue to rocket them straight to the top... the top of Page Six, anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their biggest hot-button feud began over one thing: religion. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There are many stereotypes surround Scientology</a>, but when it comes down to it, it's an elite and exclusive religion with very specific (and slightly unusual) rules. Both Cruise and Travolta are followers of the religion, each having rallied hard in the past to obtain the top spots in the hierarchy that is Scientology. With Cruise ultimately coming out on top, Travolta has allowed a jaded edge to emerge, thus leading to a bitterness that has spanned years.</p><p><strong>Updated on September 30, 2022:</strong> Although Tom Cruise seems to remain in the Church of Scientology after all these years, there seems to be accumulating evidence that John Travolta has had enough. While Travolta has not made an official statement, there have been hints that he has distanced himself from the religion, one of the most recent (and biggest) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being his post in 2020</a> regarding the passing of his wife, Kelly Preston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-feud-is-fueled-by-religion-specifically-scientology><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Feud Is Fueled By Religion, Specifically Scientology</span></h2><p>As stated before, the foundation of their ongoing feud is fueled by none other than the religion they follow. Travolta made some pretty big waves when he first began touting about the unusual religious lifestyle, and Cruise was soon to follow. However, Cruise has an intimate in with the leader of the religion, something that quickly overshadowed Travolta dedication.</p><h2 id=they-have-both-been-rallying-for-a-coveted-spot-within-the-religion><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Have Both Been Rallying For A Coveted Spot Within The Religion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the information that has been brought to light by Brendon Tighe, a former follower of Scientology who has since left the Church, its inner-workings have been somewhat revealed. As it turns out, Cruise has a direct line to leader David Miscavige, which is speculated to have had something to do with Cruise's high ranking within the Church itself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Movies John Travolta Ruined (And 10 He Saved)</a></span></p><h2 id=cruise-has-connections-that-travolta-doesn-39-t-furthering-their-bitterness><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Cruise Has Connections That Travolta Doesn't, Furthering Their Bitterness</span></h2><p>Miscavige was the best man at <a href=#>Cruise's wedding to Katie Holmes</a>, and their relationship dates back quite a bit. While Travolta doesn't have this same friendship with the leader of the Church, it could be argued that he was one of the most prominent members until Cruise became involved, thus driving a wedge between the stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travolta-was-not-on-cruise-39-s-wedding-invite-list-back-in-2006-exposing-a-grudge><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Travolta Was Not On Cruise's Wedding Invite List Back In 2006, Exposing A Grudge</span></h2><p>It was big news when Travolta was not invited to Cruise's wedding, which was deemed to be even pettier after it was revealed that Miscavige was actually a member of Cruise's wedding party. While this was a hot topic among fans, it's unclear whether Travolta would have even wanted to be there, considering their growing bitterness toward one another.</p><h2 id=cruise-was-rewarded-with-the-quot-freedom-medal-of-valor-quot-over-travolta><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cruise Was Rewarded With The "Freedom Medal Of Valor" Over Travolta</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This award is specific and exclusive to members of the church who are worthy of being recognized as a high-ranking member of the Church. Despite the efforts put forth by Travolta, the medal was rewarded to Cruise, followed by a large ceremony and a speech by the actor. To this day, some still question the reward and whether it was merited or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">17 Secrets The Travolta Family Tried To Cover Up</a></span></p><h2 id=some-people-don-39-t-think-cruise-deserves-such-a-religious-honor><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Some People Don't Think Cruise Deserves Such A Religious Honor</span></h2><p>Less elite members of the Church, as well as fans, still believe that Cruise's honor wasn't necessarily deserved. Some believe it was due to his own personal connections that he was even awarded the medal in the first place, as his lifestyle - regarding being an actor as well as his personal life - didn't necessarily equal the standards to which the religion holds its followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-close-are-cruise-and-the-church-leader-david-miscavige><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Close Are Cruise And The Church Leader, David Miscavige?</span></h2><p>Even though Cruise and Travolta were once friends as well, their friendship was not strong enough to overcome Cruise's newfound place in the Church of Scientology. While Cruise has completely altered his life and is a devout follower, Travolta has made clear that his anger over the ranking system is not dissipating anytime soon.</p><h2 id=this-apparently-caused-travolta-to-rage-against-their-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>This Apparently Caused Travolta To Rage Against Their Friendship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Cruise was awarded the Freedom Medal of Valor, Travolta supposedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote a heated letter to Miscavige</a>, demanding an explanation as to why Cruise was chosen after efforts on Travolta's part. His need for answers came after Miscavige seemed to play favorites, placing Cruise before Travolta when it had previously been the other way around. Miscavige had also referred to Cruise as the "best Scientologist he knew," leading to further fury.</p><h2 id=neither-of-them-agreed-to-the-documentary-filmed-by-hbo-for-unknown-reasons><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Neither Of Them Agreed To The Documentary Filmed By HBO, For Unknown Reasons</span></h2><p>While the documentary, produced by HBO, finally seemed to address some answers that revolved around this mysterious and exclusive religion, neither Cruise nor Travolta agreed to be featured in it. This, their chance to clear the air and/or provide insight into their personal religion, and they both declined to be involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Nicole Kidman And Tom Cruise's Marriage That Have Recently Surfaced</a></span></p><h2 id=travolta-was-the-original-shining-star-of-the-religion-as-its-first-celebrity-spokesman><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Travolta Was The Original Shining Star Of The Religion, As Its First Celebrity Spokesman</span></h2><p>Many will remember that Travolta was the first to speak up about the religion, becoming its first celebrity spokesperson, for lack of a better term. His position was uprooted when Cruise joined the club (literally) and became the "favorite son" of Miscavige, thus effectively pushing Travolta to the back of the Scientology line.</p><h2 id=miscavige-was-supposedly-partially-responsible-for-the-trouble-between-cruise-and-kidman><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Miscavige Was (Supposedly) Partially Responsible For The Trouble Between Cruise And Kidman</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miscavige is an interesting person and many have their own opinions on what he's actually capable of. Supposedly, he's known for controlling his Church members, Cruise included, and it was rumored that he hired a private investigator to follow Cruise's ex-wife, Nicole Kidman. This was likely driving a wedge between her and her now-ex-husband, Tom. Katie Holmes was also labeled a "suppressive person" by the Church after her divorce from Cruise.</p><h2 id=both-travolta-and-cruise-39-s-daughters-are-now-involved-in-the-exclusive-religion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Both Travolta And Cruise's Daughters Are Now Involved In The Exclusive Religion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like father like daughter, as it would seem, is the name of the game for both Travolta and Cruise. Isabella Cruise, whom Cruise adopted with Kidman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is now a top recruiter for the Church</a>, claiming it was "exactly what she needed." Ella Bleu Travolta has also shown an interest in furthering her own Scientology profile, and both of them seem to become more and more involved.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes Comes Clean About Life After Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYsGzrdWoo62ZXam8rnnCq6yiq5Viv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecWerJ1lo5i2prrTqKOon6lk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-travolta-and-tom-cruise-what-we-know-about-their-relationship-and-feud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./luka-doncic-rookie-card-sold-for-3-12-million-at-auction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./luka-doncic-rookie-card-sold-for-3-12-million-at-auction.html>Luka Doncic Rookie Card Sold For $3.12 Million At Auction</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hugh-bonneville-bio-downton-notting-hill-religion-sofia-the-first-mormon-harry-potter-wife-t.html>Hugh Bonneville Bio, Downton, Notting Hill, Religion, Sofia The First, Mormon, Harry Potter, Wife, T</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hugh-bonneville-bio-downton-notting-hill-religion-sofia-the-first-mormon-harry-potter-wife-t.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
