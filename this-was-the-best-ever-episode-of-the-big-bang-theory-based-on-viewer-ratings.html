Even though some episodes weren't huge hits with all audiences, there are too many highly-rated episodes to count.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From <a href=#>epic unscripted moments</a> to unexpected guest stars, including some that the <a href=#>cast members themselves insisted upon tracking down</a>, the show had a lot going for it. Tons of episodes earned high ratings, with over 100 hitting at least an 8, minimum, out of 10 on IMDb.</p><p>IMDb isn't necessarily a critics' system, of course, so most opinions come from actual viewers of the show via very casual ratings; select between 1 and 10 stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Melissa Rauch Had A Particular Favorite Scene Alongside Simon Helberg On The Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><p>Some notable high-ranking episodes include season three's episode 22; "The Staircase Implementation" finally addressed the broken elevator conundrum (and earned a 9-star rating).</p><p>"The Opening Night Excitation" (season nine, episode 11) had the gang diving into the Star Wars fandom, while "The Change Constant" was the next-to-last episode (season 12, episode 23) and had Sheldon and Amy receiving big news.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one specific episode earned higher than a nine-star rating, and is still marked as the best-ever episode of the showâ€”for a good reason.</p><h2 id=the-best-ever-big-bang-theory-episode-was-quot-the-stockholm-syndrome-quot>The Best-Ever Big Bang Theory Episode Was "The Stockholm Syndrome"</h2><p>Based on an amalgamation of reviews on IMDb, the clear winner for the best-ever Big Bang Theory episode is "The Stockholm Syndrome." The season 12, episode 24 plot was apparently flawless, as the show's IMDb rank hit 9.5 thanks to over 10,000 ratings.</p><p>Of course, The Big Bang Theory's best-ever episode was also its last, which could very well have been the reason why so many rated it highly. Rather than rating that particular episode, viewers might have been reflecting on the series as a whole in their judgment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mayim Bialik Picked Kevin Sussman As Her Favorite Guest Star On The Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><p>Many reviewers said as much, with one featured review stating that they had clearly invested 12 years into the show "wisely."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Viewers applauded the characters' growth, particularly Sheldon's, and appreciated the "heartfelt" sendoff. One reviewer summed up by saying, "There's no better way to end this series."</p><p>That was an impressive evaluation after some episodes were less than spectacular, according to fans.</p><p>Specifically, the <a href=#>lack of science in Howard's NASA storyline</a> left some fans feeling frustrated, but it was only the odd episode out that really annoyed fans... even if none ever stopped watching completely.</p><h2 id=the-second-best-big-bang-theory-episode-was-quot-the-bath-item-gift-hypothesis-quot>The Second-Best Big Bang Theory Episode Was "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-big-bang-theory-s-jim-parsons-as-sheldon-cooper-nobel-prize.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because it's somewhat unfair to label the very last episode of the series its "best," it's prudent to mention the runner-up. While "The Stockholm Syndrome" ranked at 9.5 stars, "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" was a close runner-up with 9.1 stars, thanks to nearly seven thousand ratings.</p><p>The highlight of "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" was, of course, Sheldon receiving a signed napkin from Leonard Nimoy, courtesy of Penny.</p><p>Each character also experiences a bit of growth and a relevant plotline in the episode, but the season two, episode 11 piece was also a Christmas special and was effectively delivered wrapped up in a bow.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mayim Bialik's Preparation For A Big Bang Theory Episode Was Completely Different from Jim Parsonsâ€™</a></span></p><p>The episode wasn't the only holiday special over the years (The Big Bang Theory wound up with 17 of them in the end), and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some other holiday specials</a> did come close to beating the record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Thanksgiving Decoupling," for example, earned an 8.8 score from over 4,000 ratings.</p><p>That episode featured the crew spending the holiday at Howard's house, where drama erupts thanks to the news that Penny once married her ex-boyfriend on a whim (while turning Leonard down multiple times).</p><h2 id=its-final-episode-was-also-big-bang-theory-39-s-most-watched>Its Final Episode Was Also Big Bang Theory's Most-Watched</h2><p>In addition to being its highest-rated episode, the finale of The Big Bang Theory was also its most-watched. According to Nielsen data reported by The Wrap, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Stockholm Syndrome" episode attracted a total of 23.44 million viewers</a>.</p><p>Those figures cemented TBBT as the most-watched show (outside of a sports program) for that season. CBS also showed a re-run of the episode, which wasn't included in those figures. It's possible that many more millions of viewers watched the episode during the replay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for viewers, Young Sheldon began before TBBT ended, so they still had a familiar show to tune into while TBBT ended (and still got to enjoy <a href=#><strong>Jim Parsons</strong></a>' participation as the narrator).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecGeqq1llauys3nEqaCsp5SaeqO1xmaZmqaXYsGpsc6rsGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-was-the-best-ever-episode-of-the-big-bang-theory-based-on-viewer-ratings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tony-awards-2022-ariana-debose-hair-how-to.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tony-awards-2022-ariana-debose-hair-how-to.html>Tony Awards 2022: Ariana DeBose Hair How-To</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-drew-barrymore-and-lucy-liu-s-relationship.html>The Truth About Drew Barrymore And Lucy Liu's Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-truth-about-drew-barrymore-and-lucy-liu-s-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
