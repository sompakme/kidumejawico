The upload came two months after Cassie split from ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Sean “Diddy” Combs</strong></a> after dating on and off for 11 years. Cassie <a href=#>went on to sue Diddy</a> in November 2023, claiming that the rapper began a pattern of control and abuse after they met in 2005.<p>“After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,” she said in a statement.</p><p>Diddy vehemently denied the allegations.</p><p>“Mr. Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations. For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura’s persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail,” his lawyer <strong>Ben Brafman</strong> said in a statement. “Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs’s reputation and seeking a payday.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed one day after the lawsuit was filed that Cassie and Diddy <a href=#><span class=s1>reached a settlement</span></a>.</p><h3 class=x_elementToProof>June 2019</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cassie-and-Husband-Alex-Fine-s-Relationship-Timeline-4.jpg><p>Cassie announced that she and Fine were expecting their first baby.</p><p>“Can’t wait to meet our baby girl 💗 Love You Always & Forever,” she captioned Instagram snaps of herself and Fine in a car.</p><h3 class=x_elementToProof>August 2019</h3><p>Fine asked the “Me & U singer” to marry him with a <a href=#>cowboy-themed proposal</a>.

I saw just his mouth moving and he said, ‘I Want to spend the rest of my life with you.’ I will never forget how special Alex made me feel that night.”</p><h3 class=x_elementToProof>September 2019</h3><p>Two months after getting engaged, Cassie and Fine <a href=#>had a backyard wedding</a> in Malibu.</p><p>“We wanted a simple venue with a beautiful view that felt warm and romantic,” Cassie told Vogue of the big day. “We wanted the aesthetic to reflect how comfortable and content we feel with each other.”</p><h3 class=x_elementToProof>December 2019</h3><p>The pair became parents with the birth of their daughter Frankie.</p><p>“I can’t explain the amount of unconditional love and adoration that I have for my family,” Casie captioned a September 2020 carousel of Instagram photos of herself and Fine with their newborn. “I wake up everyday so thankful and happy to have my own.
