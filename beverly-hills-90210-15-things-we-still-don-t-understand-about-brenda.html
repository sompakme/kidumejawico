From Joey Potter on&nbsp;Dawson's Creek&nbsp;to Marissa Cooper on&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;to Rory Gilmore on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls, they're the girl next door, the troubled teen, or the ambitious bookworm, and they offer up different perspectives on high school life. Another iconic character we can add to that list is Brenda Walsh on&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>90210&nbsp;might be famous because Shannen Doherty left the series pretty early on, but her character deserves a lot of attention, too. From the moment she and her family move to Beverly Hills, she makes a huge impact, and her life is changed forever.</p><p>Like most teen girls in real life and on TV, though, Brenda isn't perfect. Keep reading to find out some parts of Brenda's personality and some things she does on the show that are pretty confusing.</p><h2 id=after-her-pregnancy-scare-brenda-dumps-dylan-even-though-she-still-loves-him><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>After Her Pregnancy Scare, Brenda Dumps Dylan Even Though She Still Loves Him</span></h2><p>Many teen dramas feature pregnancy scares, and&nbsp;90210&nbsp;was no different.</p><p>When Brenda&nbsp;thinks that she might be pregnant in season two, she dumps Dylan. This isn't something that we understand, because she loves him and it seems like she can work it out with him. No relationship is perfect and without conflict.</p><h2 id=she-s-super-critical-of-the-teens-in-beverly-hills-when-she-s-new-and-should-make-friends><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>She's&nbsp;Super Critical Of The Teens In Beverly Hills When She's New And Should Make Friends</span></h2><p>Many of us have been the new kid at school at some point, and we want to make friends ASAP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brenda is super critical of the teens in Beverly Hills and this is confusing, because she's new and should make friends. She doesn't like that they shop a lot and finds that dull, which is understandable, but she should try a least a little.</p><h2 id=brenda-hates-that-dylan-cheated-on-her-with-kelly-yet-she-kissed-rick-in-paris><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Brenda Hates That Dylan Cheated On Her With Kelly, Yet She Kissed Rick In Paris</span></h2><p>Brenda makes a lot of confusing decisions on&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210. It's strange that she hates that Dylan cheated on her with Kelly... and yet she kissed Rick during her time in Paris the very same summer.</p><p>They were both unfaithful, so this is something that she really should keep in mind.</p><h2 id=why-does-free-spirit-brenda-get-engaged-to-stuart-so-fast-she-wouldn-t-want-to-settle-down-so-young><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Why Does Free Spirit Brenda Get Engaged To Stuart So Fast? She Wouldn't Want&nbsp;To Settle Down So Young</span></h2><p>In season four, Brenda gets engaged to Stuart, who her parents set her up with. We don't get this.</p><p>Why would Brenda, who is such a free spirit, get engaged to him so fast? She wouldn't want to settle down at such a young age, and she would be content to simply be in a relationship with him.</p><h2 id=brenda-blames-dylan-more-than-kelly-when-they-get-together-but-the-bff-betrayal-is-worse><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Brenda Blames Dylan More Than Kelly When They Get Together, But The BFF Betrayal Is Worse</span></h2><p>Sure, Brenda is going to be upset that her boyfriend cheated on her. That's totally a given.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The confusing part is that Brenda seems to blame Dylan much more than Kelly. Since she was literally betrayed by her BFF, we would think that would be a much harder thing to go through.</p><h2 id=brenda-has-zero-right-to-get-mad-that-dylan-dates-emily-valentine-when-they-re-not-even-together-anymore><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Brenda Has Zero Right To Get Mad That Dylan Dates Emily Valentine When They're Not Even Together Anymore</span></h2><p>Emily Valentine first appears on the show in the second season,&nbsp;where she and Dylan date.</p><p>Brenda gets mad, but she has zero right to feel that way because they're not even together anymore. If she really wanted to&nbsp;be with Dylan, then she should have stayed with him. It just makes no sense.</p><h2 id=brenda-always-acts-impulsively-then-gets-mad-when-there-are-consequences-which-makes-no-sense><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Brenda Always Acts Impulsively Then Gets Mad When There Are Consequences, Which Makes No Sense</span></h2><p>Something else that doesn't add up about Brenda, is that she acts impulsively, then gets mad when there are consequences to her actions.</p><p>One example is the season one episode "Stand (Up) And Deliver" when Brenda wants to leave her home and house sit for an older friend. This isn't the best idea when you're in high school. She's shocked when it works out terribly, but why didn't she realize that?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-takes-her-forever-to-be-nice-to-donna-and-andrea-but-they-re-the-nicest-ones-at-the-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>It Takes Her Forever To Be Nice To Donna And Andrea, But They're The Nicest Ones At The School</span></h2><p>It doesn't make any sense that it takes forever for Brenda to be nice to Donna and Andrea.</p><p>She goes to Paris with Donna and that's when they're close friends, and she's nice to Andrea once they work on the teen helpline together. But they're the sweetest people at the high school, and instead of becoming so obsessed with Kelly, she should broaden her friendship horizons more at first.</p><h2 id=she-freaks-out-that-dylan-is-too-intense-for-her-yet-keeps-wanting-to-date-older-guys><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Freaks Out That Dylan Is Too Intense For Her, Yet Keeps Wanting To Date Older Guys</span></h2><p>A big season one storyline is whether Brenda will take the next intimate step in her relationship with Dylan. She freaks out that he's too intense for her and it's hard for her to see a future with him.</p><p>So it makes no sense that Brenda keeps wanting to date older guys, from&nbsp;Jason in season one to Stuart in season four.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Things That Happened On The Set Of Beverly Hills, 90210</a></span></p><h2 id=brenda-should-understand-why-her-family-is-nervous-about-dylan-but-she-rebels-instead><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brenda Should Understand Why Her Family Is Nervous About Dylan, But She Rebels Instead</span></h2><p>Brenda should definitely understand why her family (her parents in particular) is nervous about her being with Dylan. She rebels instead, moving in with him in season three and continuing to date him even though they don't want her to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's close with her parents and is family-oriented, so this makes no sense.</p><h2 id=she-can-t-make-up-her-mind-about-living-in-minnesota-or-beverly-hills><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Can't Make Up Her Mind About Living In Minnesota Or Beverly Hills</span></h2><p>Another thing that we just don't get about Brenda is that she can't make up her mind about living in Minnesota or Beverly Hills.</p><p>She's upset when her dad could move the family back in the season one finale... yet later on, she moves back for college, then it doesn't work out so she comes back to California. She seems to do much better in Beverly Hills since she's popular, has friends, and has experienced love.</p><h2 id=brenda-knows-her-dad-is-super-traditional-yet-makes-awkward-comments-to-him-about-boys><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brenda Knows Her Dad Is Super Traditional, Yet Makes Awkward Comments To Him About Boys</span></h2><p>In one scene, Brenda says to her dad, Jim Walsh, "Those nice boys may be mild-mannered on the outside, but mostly all they think about is..."</p><p>Brenda knows that her dad is super traditional and on the conservative side, so why does she make such awkward comments to him about boys?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BH90210 Cast: 17 Photos From The First Season Vs.

It just doesn't seem like the right time to take such a big trip, and it's something that we're curious about.</p><h2 id=she-s-mad-when-her-friends-don-t-support-her-season-four-activism-but-they-re-just-worried-about-her><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She's Mad When Her Friends Don't Support Her Season Four Activism, But They're Just Worried About Her</span></h2><p>In the fourth season of&nbsp;90210, Brenda becomes an activist. She gets mad when her friends don't support this side of her.</p><p>However, they're definitely just worried about her, so we don't know why she doesn't see that. They care about her and have never done anything to suggest otherwise.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics That Make Us Miss Luke Perry</a></span></p><h2 id=since-they-re-both-new-in-an-overwhelming-town-brenda-and-brandon-should-lean-on-each-other-more-in-season-one><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Since They're Both New In An Overwhelming Town, Brenda And Brandon Should Lean On Each Other More In Season One</span></h2><p>Finally, we don't get why Brenda doesn't lean on Brandon more, especially in the first season of the show.</p><p>They're both new in town (and it's a super overwhelming, wealthy area at that), so shouldn't they become even closer? It's just one of many things that don't make a lot of sense about Brenda Walsh.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 90s Shows You Can Watch Today (And Where To Find Them)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnq6Vp7m6eceio6WrXW59c32PZquvZaOdvLh51qGwZpqimrulrYydpp6rnql6rq3KnmSsnZ6osnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeverly-hills-90210-15-things-we-still-don-t-understand-about-brenda.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./boris-becker-net-worth-wife-children-age-biography-wiki-family-siblings-height-weight-soci.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./boris-becker-net-worth-wife-children-age-biography-wiki-family-siblings-height-weight-soci.html>Boris Becker Net Worth, Wife, Children, Age, Biography, Wiki, Family, Siblings, Height, Weight, Soci</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-regrets-not-getting-a-prenup-as-her-divorce-gets-messy.html>Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Regrets Not Getting A Prenup As Her Divorce Gets Messy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-regrets-not-getting-a-prenup-as-her-divorce-gets-messy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
