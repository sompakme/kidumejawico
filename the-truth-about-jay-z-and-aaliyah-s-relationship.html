The "Try Again" hitmaker was at the height of her career — every girl wanted to be her and all the boys wanted her. But despite being linked to several men at that time, the R&B singer always <strong>kept her love life private</strong>. At least, except for her <a href=#>now-publicized illegal marriage to R. Kelly</a> when she was only 15-years-old.</p><p>But in 2021, Damon Dash spilled some secrets about the At Your Best singer's romantic life. Aaliyah never spoke about their relationship in public, but the record executive later revealed that they dated from 2000 until her death. They had even discussed marriage. But <strong>Dash's biggest revelation was about the fling between Aaliyah and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jay-Z</a></strong>. The rapper apparently tried "very hard" to get her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Beyoncé And Jay-Z Were Reported To The Authorities After Blue Ivy Carter's Birth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The birth of Ivy Blue Carter resulted in Beyoncé And Jay-Z getting reported to healthcare authorities who investigated the incident.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024: </strong>Jay-Z has been happily married to global superstar <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> since 2008, who just recently released her country album, "Cowboy Carter". While the album has received critical praise and will add to the empire that she and Jay-Z have built, people are waiting to see if there will be any blowback on Jay-Z from the Sean Combs federal investigation. With other celebrities claiming to have seen questionable conduct at Combs' parties, Jay-Z may have information either the feds or other law enforcement can use to build one or more cases against Combs based on evidence seized. A fact that will not be known until more information about the investigation into Combs and his alleged sex and drug trafficking comes to light.</p><h2 id=an-inside-look-at-aaliyah-and-jay-z-39-s-relationship>An Inside Look At Aaliyah And Jay-Z's Relationship</h2><h3 id=aaliyah-and-jay-z-dated-briefly-in-1999>Aaliyah and Jay-Z dated briefly in 1999</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar50545301-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Page Six in 2009, Dash said that <strong>"everybody was trying to get to Aaliyah."</strong> However, he said he never pursued her as "hard" as Jay-Z did. The "99 Problems" rapper was rumored to be dating the Queen of the Damned actress in 1999. <strong>They were 29 and 20, respectively</strong>.</p><p>But soon, Dash won Aaliyah over and her fling with Jay-Z never materialized. "I did not know Jay was trying to holler at her, but then it just happened like that," the film producer said about unexpectedly falling for the "One in a Million" singer. "He was trying, I was trying. Everybody was trying — he was going hard."</p><p>Then there was this different version of the story: "Dame went behind [Jay-Z’s] back and hollered at [Aaliyah]." It came from producer Choke No Joke, who worked at Roc-A-Fella Records — a hip-hop label co-founded by Dash, Jay-Z, and Kareem "Biggs" Burke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to what was implied in Choke No Joke's statement, it appears that the former Roc-A-Fella owners drifted apart due to professional conflicts. Aaliyah even hung out at the house Dash and Jay-Z shared weeks before the tragic accident.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:08</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-real-reason-why-fans-rarely-see-jay-z-and-beyonc-s-son-sir-carter.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Fans Rarely See Jay-Z and Beyoncé's Son Sir Carter</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jay-Z and Beyoncé's son, Sir Carter, has rarely been seen, but fans wonder if a traumatic experience is the reason why...</span><h2 id=aaliyah-might-have-actually-dumped-jay-z>Aaliyah Might Have Actually Dumped Jay-Z</h2><h3 id=aaliyah-started-dating-dame-dash-and-that-may-have-been-what-caused-her-to-stop-seeing-jay-z>Aaliyah started dating Dame Dash and that may have been what caused her to stop seeing Jay-Z</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar50545118-1.jpg><p>According to Dash, <strong>Aaliyah and Jay-Z were not seriously dating</strong>. "It was just a situation where Aaliyah was the type of girl that would give you a shot. She didn’t care what people thought or whatever. So, she’ll date you and be your friend," the entertainment executive said.</p><p>He continued: "You might end up in the friend zone. A lot of times, that’s what happened.

"We’ve always been polar opposites," the rapper said. For a while, they maintained that they were still friends.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2021: Dash went forward in suing Jay-Z over the streaming rights for his 1996 studio album, Reasonable Doubt.</p><p>Prior to that, <strong>Roc-A-Fella filed a lawsuit against Dash</strong>, who allegedly tried to sell the album's copyright as a non-fungible token (NFT).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2023, Dash said that he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">willing to put the beef had with Jay-Z behind him.</a></p><p>"I always said as a man that we could always talk it up," Dash explained. "Men should always be able to talk things up, but I’m really happy with my life right now.
