Over the past few years, E! Network shows like Total Divas and Total Bellas have allowed WWE to showcase many of the couples that their industry has created, but there are a few couples that weren't able to be featured on these kinds of shows and many of these were unions that even the company probably didn't think would last. There are a number of WWE superstars who were part of relationships with someone else in the company now that they have to continue to work with because they were once in a relationship that didn't work out.</p><p>This is becoming more and more common in wrestling nowadays as more couples announce that they are in relationships and inevitably become part of a union that many fans begin predicting won't last. While there are many strange couples who have defied the odds and remained together despite their differences, there are many more who have been unable to make go the distance and make their relationship work when things got tough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following is a list of just 15 of the most shocking wrestling breakups of the past few years, the ones that the WWE Universe genuinely thought would last. These&nbsp;couples seemed to have decided to give up at the first hurdle.</p><h2 id=austin-aries-and-thea-trinidad>Austin Aries And Thea Trinidad</h2><p>Austin Aries and Thea Trinidad started dating when the couple first met in Impact Wrestling, the duo then later followed each other over to WWE where Austin Aries was once part of both NXT and the 205 Live brand.</p><p><strong>Thea joined NXT under the ring name Zelina Vega and has since been instrumental in helping Andrade "Cien" Almas to not only become NXT Champion but be promoted to the SmackDown Live roster.</strong></p><p>Aries walked away from WWE back in 2017 following WrestleMania 33 and recent reports&nbsp;on <a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;are suggesting that Thea and Austin parted ways not long afterward since the couple stopped following each other on social media and Aries then touched on his breakup in a recent House of Hardcore promo. Aries and Thea were together for a number of years and engaged throughout their stay in WWE, so it came as a huge shock for many fans when it was revealed that they had split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-woods-and-nia-jax>Josh Woods And Nia Jax</h2><p>Nia Jax spent a large portion of her early WWE career down in NXT and while she was there she started dating fellow superstar Josh Woods.</p><p><strong>Nia and Josh dated for more than a year and even bought a dog together before they decided to go their separate ways at some point last year.</strong></p><p>Nia was added to the cast of Total Divas in the fall of 2017 and has been seen going to <a href=#>speed dating events</a>&nbsp;and asking her friends for help when it comes to her relationship status, even getting emotional about it at one point, which means that she is obviously now single. Jax is the current Raw Women's Champion so even though her personal life doesn't seem to be measuring up to what she expected, at least her professional life is working out well.&nbsp;Hopefully, there will be news of a new love in her life soon.</p><h2 id=wade-barrett-and-alicia-fox>Wade Barrett And Alicia Fox</h2><p>Wade Barrett hasn't been seen in WWE now since 2016, but while he was part of the company he was in quite a private relationship with fellow WWE star Alicia Fox. Wade and Alicia tried to keep their relationship out of the headlines but did look like a cute couple when they were pictured together and the star later confirmed their relationship in an interview with <a href=#>The Sun</a>. This relationship came to an end back in 2015 since it was revealed on an episode of Total Divas that Alicia was still trying to get over this heartbreak.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fox was even seen backstage confronting the former WWE superstar to ask what it was she did wrong, but the main reason for their break up was that Barrett was assessing his future at the time and Alicia wasn't someone that he saw in it.</strong></p><p>While he did love her, he thought that this was the best thing for both of them, which was quite heartbreaking to watch.</p><h2 id=rob-van-dam-and-sonya-szatkowski>Rob Van Dam And Sonya Szatkowski</h2><p>Rob Van Dam married his wife Sonya Szatkowski back in 1998 and it looked as though the couple was happy throughout Van Dam's run in WWE. RVD was one of the most exciting superstars of the current generation but it was reported back in 2015 that the star couldn't return to the ring now because of a concussion issue that was stopping him from being declared medically fit.</p><p>This claim was made by Van Dam in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>The&nbsp;Sun</a>&nbsp;where he also revealed that he was battling his now ex-wife Sonya in a divorce settlement and trying to prove that she shouldn't be able to claim much of his fortune because he was now unable to wrestle and earn the money that he once could. It was made public knowledge that the couple went their separate ways back in 2015 after 17 years of marriage, something that came as a huge shock to the WWE Universe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bray-wyatt-and-samantha-rotunda>Bray Wyatt And Samantha Rotunda</h2><p>One of the biggest shocks of 2017 was revealed back in the summer when the former leader of the Wyatt family Bray's wife of five years Samantha Rotunda filed for divorce and it was reported&nbsp;by <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a> that this was because he was seeing WWE ring announcer JoJo Offerman.</p><p>Wyatt and his wife married back in 2012 and have two young daughters together, but the former WWE Champion had his head turned by Offerman, who came to WWE though the 2013 Diva Search and was once part of Total Divas.&nbsp;Offerman and Wyatt have continued their relationship since and there have been numerous reports stating that Wyatt has been spending his money on his new girlfriend rather than on the child support that he agreed to pay, which has left many members of the WWE Universe with a bad taste in their mouths.</p><h2 id=pj-braun-and-kaitlyn>PJ Braun And Kaitlyn</h2><p>Kaitlyn left WWE back in 2014 but will be best remembered as the winner of Season three of NXT as well as being a former Divas Champion. Kaitlyn had an impressive run in WWE, but after five years with the company, she decided to call it quits in January 2014. One of the reasons for this was because she wanted to get married and start her own clothing company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kaitlyn married her long-time boyfriend and fellow bodybuilder PJ Braun back in the summer of 2014, but it was reported by Sportskeeda in the spring of 2017 that the couple was going through a bad divorce&nbsp;that even forced Kaitlyn to close down her clothing company's online store for a few weeks.</strong></p><p>Their divorce was finalized back in September last year and the former WWE Diva has since been able to return to the wrestling ring for the first time in four years as it seems as though she wants to reignite her career.</p><h2 id=sheldon-souray-and-kelly-kelly>Sheldon Souray And Kelly Kelly</h2><p>Kelly Kelly is a former Divas Champion in WWE and someone who had quite the reputation when it came to her personal life while she was working for WWE. Kelly was linked to a number of fellow superstars including CM Punk, Batista, Justin Gabriel, Chris Jericho and John Cena while she was part of the company, but she managed to settle down after her departure when she met Ice Hockey player Sheldon Souray at a party back in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The couple later&nbsp;married in 2016, but their marriage ended up lasting less than a year,&nbsp;as it was reported by US Magazine that the couple had filed for divorce in 2017.</strong></p><p>Kelly has since returned to WWE to be part of the first ever Women's Royal Rumble match back in January and has continued to work as an ambassador for the company over the past few years.</p><h2 id=davey-richards-and-angelina-love>Davey Richards And Angelina Love</h2><p>Davey Richards and Angelina Love worked together throughout their time in Impact Wrestling, where Love is a former six-time TNA Knockout's Champion and Richards is a former five-time Tag Team Champion.</p><p><strong>It was revealed that the couple first started dating back in January 2015, before announcing their engagement a few months later in April.</strong></p><p>The duo then married in June 2015 after only dating for five months and&nbsp;later announced in July that they were expecting their first child. Love gave birth to a son called&nbsp;David Vincent Richards in March 2016, but it was then reported by <a href=#>Wrestling Inc </a>back in November 2017 that the couple had decided to divorce. Love and Richards were a couple that many fans thought would definitely last but even a couple that looked like a complete match was unable to go the distance after they both left TNA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alberto-del-rio-and-paige>Alberto Del Rio And Paige</h2><p>Alberto Del Rio and Paige were one of the most talked about couples throughout 2016 and 2017 after the duo finally made it public knowledge that they were in a relationship in the spring of 2016. The age gap was the biggest issue for many fans to overcome, but the relationship then went into turmoil when Paige was suspended from WWE in the summer of 2016 alongside her boyfriend, which then led to a number of months that the former Divas Champion would rather forget.</p><p><strong>After a number of public arguments and reports of backstage issues, it was reported by WhatCulture in the fall of 2017 that the couple had finally gone their separate ways.</strong></p><p>Many fans thought that the couple had overcome a number of obstacles already, so were quite shocked that they had decided to split just weeks before Paige made her return to WWE back in November.</p><h2 id=dolph-ziggler-and-dana-brooke>Dolph Ziggler And Dana Brooke</h2><p>Dana Brooke started her WWE career in NXT and while she was part of the developmental brand, she was introduced to former World Champion Dolph Ziggler. Brooke and Ziggler were reported to be a couple back in 2016 but unlike a number of other couples in WWE at the time, the duo never officially admitted that they were an item, but the images they shared online more than revealed it was true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ziggler and Brooke were drafted to different brands in the draft back in the summer of 2016 and this caused them a number of issues, since it was later reported that Dana had moved on to a new man. It was reported by<a href=#> PWTorch</a> that Dana's new boyfriend Dallas McCarver died in the summer of last year and the current Raw superstar has decided to remain single in the months that have followed.</p><h2 id=david-otunga-and-jennifer-hudson>David Otunga And Jennifer Hudson</h2><p>Jennifer Hudson is perhaps more famous than her WWE star boyfriend since she first found fame as part of American Idol before she was cast in Dreamgirls alongside Beyonce. The couple met back in 2008 and just six months later Otunga proposed to Hudson on her birthday later that year.</p><p><strong>In August 2009, Hudson gave birth to the couple's son David Daniel Otunga, but even though the couple was engaged for nine years, they never quite made it down the aisle.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>E! News</a>&nbsp;reported back in the fall of 2017 that Otunga and Hudson had decided to split and Hudson had filed for a protective order against her fiancé.&nbsp;This was then dismissed a few months later and Otunga was given primary custody of his son David. Otunga has also since returned to WWE TV as a commentator and has been relegated to a pre-show analyst given his other commitments outside of the company.</p><h2 id=enzo-amore-and-liv-morgan>Enzo Amore And Liv Morgan</h2><p>Enzo Amore is a former Cruiserweight Champion in WWE, but following his release from the company earlier this year, fans will now remember Amore for his personal life much more than his professional career. Amore met Liv Morgan when the couple worked together at Hooters and it was reported that Amore helped Morgan to land a tryout with WWE.</p><p>The couple then dated throughout their time in NXT, before it was reported by <a href=#>Sportskeeda</a> in the summer of 2017 that Amore and Morgan had gone their separate ways after Amore&nbsp;betrayed Morgan.&nbsp; The current Raw superstar has since been linked to former WWE United Kingdom Champion Tyler Bate after the duo were seen exchanging messages on social media, but she recently came out publicly and revealed that she is now single as part of WrestleMania weekend a few weeks ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zack-ryder-and-emma>Zack Ryder And Emma</h2><p>Zack Ryder and Emma were seen as the perfect couple when it was revealed that they were in a relationship back in 2016. The couple had both been overlooked throughout their wrestling career, so fans were&nbsp;content that they had found some sort of happiness of their own outside of the ring.</p><p>Ryder and Emma met during their time together down in NXT, but when the draft took center stage back in the summer of 2016, Emma and Zack were split and put on separate rosters and the distance caused a problem. It was reported by <a href=#>The Daily Star</a>&nbsp;in early 2017 that Ryder was now dating former TNA Knockout Chelsea Green, even though he never made it official that he was no longer dating Emma. Emma has since been released from WWE and has made her debut on the Independent Circuit, while Ryder has remained part of WWE, even though he is still being overlooked.</p><h2 id=big-cass-and-carmella>Big Cass And Carmella</h2><p>Big Cass and Carmella were both part of a stable on NXT that also included Enzo Amore, which led to the couple dating in real life. The group became popular in NXT but Amore and Cass were promoted to the main roster in 2016 following WrestleMania, without Carmella, who later followed in the summer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carmella was drafted to SmackDown while Amore and Cass remained on Raw and the long distance caused a number of issues. Cass was then injured in the summer of 2017 and required knee surgery, and it was then reported by <a href=#>WrestlingInc</a>&nbsp;that the frustrations of Cass' recent injury was one of the main reasons that he and Carmella decided to split. The couple had only recently bought a house together and were added to the cast of&nbsp;Total Divas&nbsp;last year, which is why the split came as such a huge shock.</p><h2 id=john-cena-and-nikki-bella>John Cena And Nikki Bella</h2><p>John Cena and Nikki Bella have been the power couple of WWE ever since 2013 when Total Divas first aired. The couple has been dating since 2012, but only finally became engaged when Cena proposed to Nikki in front of 75,000 fans at WrestleMania 33 last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cena and Nikki have been planning their wedding over the past few months, something that was featured on Total Divas, which is why it came as a huge shock when <a href=#>Sky Sports</a>&nbsp;reported that the couple had split last week. The duo was just three weeks away from their marriage but it was revealed that Bella was the one who decided to end their engagement when it became clear to her that Cena was just going through the motions and she wasn't sure that he actually wanted to marry her. The couple has stayed out of the spotlight since their split was made public knowledge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toaWViv6avxKerZq%2BimsC1uMinnmaaopqurMHPrGStoJGperTB0ampoquVmXq1tMRmrrCdXaq7qsLEq6qeZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-recent-wrestling-breakups-that-surprised-the-wwe-universe.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15-secrets-about-jay-z-and-beyonc%C3%A9-s-marriage-you-don-t-want-to-miss.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15-secrets-about-jay-z-and-beyonc%C3%A9-s-marriage-you-don-t-want-to-miss.html>15 Secrets About Jay Z and Beyoncs Marriage You Dont Want to Miss</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-why-this-lindsay-lohan-co-star-disappeared-from-acting.html>The Truth About Why This Lindsay Lohan Co-Star Disappeared From Acting</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-truth-about-why-this-lindsay-lohan-co-star-disappeared-from-acting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
