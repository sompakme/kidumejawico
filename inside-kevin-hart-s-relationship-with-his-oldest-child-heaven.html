While his life as a Hollywood star is synonymous to movie sets, red carpet appearances, and unending interviews, Kevin's most important title and role is being a dad to his four kids, <strong>Heaven</strong>, <strong>Hendrix</strong>, <strong>Kenzo</strong>, and <strong>Kaori</strong>. And he never forgets that.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Kevin Hart Recently Revealed About His Public Scandals</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kevin shares his two oldest kids, Heaven and Hendrix, with his ex-wife <strong>Torrei Hart</strong>. The former couple got married in 2003 and got divorced eight years later in 2011. However, despite their failed marriage, Torrei and Hart have created a healthy co-parenting environment, allowing the actor to be actively present in his kids' lives. Therefore, it is no surprise that Kevin has an incredible relationship with Heaven, who is currently 16 years. In recent years, the father-daughter duo has given us a glimpse of their relationship, and now we are bringing all of the scoop. Take a look!</span></p><h2 id=they-are-besties><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Are Besties</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is not very common to have your daughter as a best friend, but for Kevin Hart, he would not have it any other way. Taking to Instagram in August 2020, the actor shared a heartwarming photo of himself and Heaven while lounging on a couch. He shared the snapshot alongside a caption revealing that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she drives him crazy </a>but he loves her altogether.&nbsp; "Me & my bestie....this little girl drives me insane but I wouldn’t have it any other way," Kevin proudly wrote.</p><h2 id=they-play-pranks-on-each-other><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Play Pranks On Each Other</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin and Heaven seem to have cracked through the stereotype of dads having a serious relationship with their daughters as the pair can often be caught pranking each other. This is evident in their numerous spirited social media posts, including a 2019 Instagram that saw Kevin throwing a fully dressed Heaven into the pool. The actor explained that pushing his daughter into the pool was payback for a prank she pulled on him during that year's Father Day's celebration. Talk about a perfect tit for tat situation!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Kevin Hart and J.T. Jackson Still Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=kevin-is-not-afraid-to-look-silly-for-heaven><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kevin Is Not Afraid To Look Silly For Heaven</span></h2><p>Dancing on TikTok with your daughter might seem too silly for many dads but for Kevin Hart, what's a little embarrassment compared to his love for Heaven. So when he is not pranking her, you can find Kevin dancing with his daughter. Back in 2019, the father-daughter duo released a video that showed them busting some choreographed moves to DaBaby's Bop. The video stirred up reactions from several internet users, with some wishing their dad was as cool as Kevin and many commenting on how much of an amazing dad the actor is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-scared-of-her-liking-boys><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Is Scared Of Her Liking Boys</span></h2><p>Hart is ready to give Heaven the whole world, but he has one big fear concerning his daughter— boys!. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2017 interview with E! News</a>, the actor admitted that it was difficult dealing with the fact that a then 12-year-old Heaven already had crushes. But despite these fears, Hart noted that he did not want to scare her off and would not be instituting a no--boy-policy rule. So, Heaven can continue talking to her dad about boys for as long as she likes!</p><h2 id=kevin-spoils-his-daughter><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><span style=color:#000>Kevin Spoils His Daughter</span></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a reported net worth of $200 million, it is only fitting that Kevin sometimes splurges money on his kids. Heaven's 16th birthday was no exception, as the actor<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> surprised her with a luxury brand new Mercedes</a>. A video capturing the heartwarming moment Kevin presented Heaven with the car was shared on the Shade Room's Instagram page, and fans could not stop swooning!</p><p>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart's 'Unreal' Watch Almost Cost 100k</a></p><h2 id=he-celebrates-her-achievements><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><span style=color:#000>He Celebrates Her Achievements</span></span></h2><p>In addition to spoiling her, Kevin also enjoys celebrating his daughter's achievements, no matter how small. When Heaven graduated from the sixth grade in 2017, the proud actor took to his Instagram page with a congratulatory post where he gushed about how far she had come. Kevin concluded by letting the 12-year-old how much he loves her while assuring her that the world is hers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-hold-him-accountable><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><span style=color:#000>She Hold Him Accountable</span></span></h2><p>Kevin's close bond with Heaven is not restricted to playing pranks and dancing as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the teenager seemingly also holds her dad accountable</a> when there is a need. The Jumanji actor recently revealed that after his 2017 cheating scandal, having a conversation with Heaven was the most difficult. He admitted that getting Heaven to see how sorry he was and that he was still the same person was daunting. Kevin explained:</p><p>"My daughter touched on that chord man when we and my wife went through what we went through. That whole cheating display....God damn, God damn, That was one like no other. Getting my daughter back, getting my daughter to understand that I was sorry, that I made a mistake, that was real. To understand, I'm still dad..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Kevin and Heaven have seemingly gotten their relationship back on track, it is impressive to see that she wants no part in her dad's bad behavior, But with the incredible love she has for him, Heaven will no doubt always be there for her dad like he will always be there for her!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart Reveals His Daughter Hold Him Accountable For His Infidelities</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJut8SvoKdlmJa%2Ftb%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVutMisZKiklJrAtXnCoaClnF2dsqLCxKdm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-kevin-hart-s-relationship-with-his-oldest-child-heaven.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joanna-angel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joanna-angel-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Joanna Angel Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-rich-is-alice-oseman-author-of-heartstopper-is-proud-of-her-work-s-popularity-in-netflix.html>How Rich Is Alice Oseman?
