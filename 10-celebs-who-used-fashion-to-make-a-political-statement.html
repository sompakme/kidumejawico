The clothes that a person puts on doesn't tell the whole story, but it can say a lot about them. People express their personalities and mood at any given time through their fashion choices. When you're in the spotlight, it means that everyone is going to be looking at what you're wearing. People tune in to awards shows to, of course, see the performances and who is going to take home the trophies. However, people also tune in to see what their favorite stars are wearing on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Nas X And 9 Other Male Celebs Who Are Pushing The Boundaries Of Fashion</a></span></p><p>Some stars aren't scared to push the envelope when using their style choices to make a political statement.

In 2001, Gray was a presenter and used the opportunity to promote her new album. The front of her blue dress with pink sleeves that she wore stated, "MY NEW ALBUM DROPS SEPT. 18 2001." and the back displayed the words "BUY IT." Her album, "The Id," peaked at #11 on the Billboard 200 charts. Stars promote their albums all the time, but no one else but the "I Try" singer marketed their album in this way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-ap-rocky-supported-feminism><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A$AP Rocky Supported Feminism</span></h2><p>Lauren Fisher, a writer for <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harpers Bazaar</a>, called out <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna's beau A$AP Rocky</a> for wearing a Dior shirt that stated: "We Should All Be Feminists" while he was in a music video where he referred to women as "B******." Celebrities at the Women's March, such as Rihanna, wore this shirt as well. In the music video for 2017's "Wrong," the A$AP Mob rappers make an apology to women for their womanizing ways, but ASAP Ferg rapped the lyrics, "Man I done lost me a classy b****."</p><h2 id=jenifer-lewis-supported-colin-kaepernick><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jenifer Lewis Supported Colin Kaepernick</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the Emmy's, you expect stars to wear fabulous dresses and tuxedos. However, in 2018, the Black-ish star wore a Nike Outfit supporting Colin Kaepernick. Nike decided to use the former NFL star in their 30th anniversary "Just Do It" campaign. She also proudly wore her hair in an afro.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Kaepernick Isn’t Playing In The XFL… It Has Nothing To Do With The NFL</a></span></p><h2 id=joy-villa-showed-her-support-of-donald-trump><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Joy Villa Showed Her Support Of Donald Trump</span></h2><p>In 2019, at the Grammys Awards, the singer-songwriter, actress, and YouTuber wore a plunging white floor-length dress that resembled a brick law outlined with black bricks. The back of her dress, in red lettering, said "Build the Wall," and her red clutch displayed the words "Make America Great Again." This display wasn't the first time she wore Trump-supportive fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laverne-cox-supported-the-lgbtq-community-with-a-clutch><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Laverne Cox Supported the LGBTQ Community With A Clutch</span></h2><p>The Orange Is the New Black actress showcased a custom Edie Parker rainbow clutch to the 2019 Emmys, which read "Oct. 8, Title VII, Supreme Court."

Cox told <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!</a> that people weren't highly aware of this issue and that it affected women but also anyone who didn't conform to someone else's "idea of how you should be."</p><h2 id=katy-perry-has-used-her-fashion-to-support-barack-obama><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Katy Perry Has Used Her Fashion To Support Barack Obama</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, at the Delta Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Perry performed at a rally supporting then-president Barack Obama after his first term. She wore a skin-tight blue dress with the word "Forward" on it in white lettering with rhinestones. Perry also performed at another rally in Las Vegas. Her dress resembled a checked or darkened ballot box next to the words "President Of The United States Barack Obama, Illinois, Joe Biden, Delaware." There was a blank box next to "Mitt Romney Massachusetts."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Are Unrecognizable In New Selfie</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-rose-and-blac-chyna-made-it-clear-that-women-can-be-sexually-expressive><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Amber Rose And Blac Chyna Made It Clear That Women Can Be Sexually Expressive</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, there is never a dull moment at the VMAs. Chyna wore a custom dress, and Rose wore a custom jumpsuit. The outfits displayed words such as "stripper," "gold digger," and other words that men have used to shame women. Rose and Chyna decided to embrace the words that people called them all the time. At the time, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose was also promoting Slutwalk</a>, a transnational movement that attempts to dismantle rap culture, victim-blaming, and shaming women, particularly victims of sexual assault.</p><h2 id=connie-britton-wanted-people-to-know-that-poverty-is-sexist><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Connie Britton Wanted People To Know That Poverty Is Sexist</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, the Friday Night Lights actress wore a black sweater that stated "Poverty is Sexist" in honor of the Time's Up Movement. Celebrities founded this charity to support sexual harassment victims based on the ME TOO movement and the Weinstein effect. Britton, via <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, stated that she didn't feel like a $5,000 gown would have the same effect. She expressed that this message highlighted that nowhere in the world are women economically equal to men, nor do they have the same opportunities. Designer Lingua Franca donated $100 from each purchase to the charity.</p><h2 id=issa-rae-wanted-to-express-that-all-black-people-are-stars><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Issa Rae Wanted To Express That All Black People Are Stars</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Insecure actress hosted the CFDA Fashion Awards in 2018. She wore a stunning blue sparkling one-shouldered dress. However, if you zoom into the belt around her waist, it reads, "Every n**** is a star." So, what is the meaning behind this? Well, it's deeper than Black people merely being talented. The politically-minded designer Kerby Jean-Raymond added the belt at the last minute because he feels that Black people have been depicted as tragic figures or "firsts." He expressed that Black people can be bus drivers or ordinary people and that they don't all have to be Jay-Z's or an Issa Rae, and they can merely exist.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga-s-meat-dress><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lady Gaga's Meat Dress</span></h2><p>Franc Fernandez designed the dress made of raw beef that the "Born This Way" singer wore to the 2010 VMAs. Gaga used the dress to politicize her opposition to the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy in the military. President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen repealed this policy in 2011. So, why the beef, in particular? Gaga explained on the Ellen DeGeneres&nbsp;Show that if people don't stand up for their rights, they will have as many rights as the meat on their bones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Lady Gaga’s Tragic Pregnancy</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZK6rlZl6p63SoaCopl2pvG65wKScZpldpbyttdOimpqkXajBosDEppynrF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-used-fashion-to-make-a-political-statement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./addison-rae-and-omer-fedi-are-getting-serious-with-each-other.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./addison-rae-and-omer-fedi-are-getting-serious-with-each-other.html>Addison Rae and Omer Fedi Are Getting Serious With Each Other</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-tommy-fleetwood-s-wife-clare-fleetwood-and-what-s-her-job.html>Who Is Tommy Fleetwoods Wife, Clare Fleetwood, And Whats Her Job?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-tommy-fleetwood-s-wife-clare-fleetwood-and-what-s-her-job.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
