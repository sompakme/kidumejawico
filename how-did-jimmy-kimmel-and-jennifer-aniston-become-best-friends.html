Now he tricks Jennifer Aniston into a ‘Friends’ reunion-like situation, She’s obviously not happy about it.

It’s weird. 99 percent of the time you put something on YouTube, everyone jumps in to say its fake. Then we put something that is — I thought — obviously fake, and people think it’s real.”</p><p>To those who were wondering whether the skit was real, the father-of-four added that he’s been friends with Aniston for years and she was totally in on the joke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Kimmel joked that he became jealous of Aniston’s appearance on a talk show by another “Jimmy,” referring to Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show.</p><p>Aniston frequently goes on vacation with Kimmel and his wife, whom she has even enjoyed girls’ trips out of the country with, which has provided plenty of good content for the popular TV personalities to talk about during their televised interviews.</p><p>At the 2020 Emmy Awards, Aniston and Kimmel presented an award together; the same week they also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donated a $10,000 Postmates gift card</a> to a cardiovascular nurse named Kimball Fairbanks. It was revealed that the Utah native had been tested positive for the coronavirus, so the gesture was certainly appreciated by the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Jimmy Kimmel Really Thinks About His Former Comedy Partner Adam Carolla</a></span></p><p>In a video call on his ABC show, Aniston joined Fairbanks to share the joyful news of her win as Kimmel started by saying: “We wanted to cheer you up a little bit, so I'd like you to meet somebody. Her name is Jennifer.”</p><p>Aniston had chimed in: “I just have to say, God bless you and all of you that are out there doing what you're doing.”</p><p>They also sent gift cards to Fairbanks’ coworkers who had been affected by the pandemic.</p><p>After the surprise, Aniston told Kimmel how happy she was to still be in close contact with her pal amid the growing spread of the coronavirus which had left Brad Pitt’s ex-wife staying firm in lockdown at her Los Angeles mansion.</p><p>“I'm so happy to be with you...
