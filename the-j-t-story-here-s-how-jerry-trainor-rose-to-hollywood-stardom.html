Born to <a href=#>retired Navy fighter pilot</a> and public defender, Bill Trainor, and retired high school calculus teacher, Madelyn Trainor, Jerry's family was his first taste of the spotlight. Growing up in the Scripps Ranch community, he attended the University of San Diego High School, where he quickly made a name for himself as a class clown.</p><p>After high school, Jerry went on to study drama at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he perfected his craft and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. But before he was <a href=#>performing for sold-out crowds</a>, he was a humble worker at San Diego SeaWorld, making waves in his own way. With his Irish roots and quick wit, it's no surprise that Jerry Trainor was destined for greatness from the very beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's How Jason Aldean Became A Country Music Powerhouse" href=#>Here's How Jason Aldean Became A Country Music Powerhouse</a></span></p><h2 id=jerry-trainor-s-first-steps-in-the-show-business>Jerry Trainor's First Steps In The Show Business</h2><p>Jerry Trainor's entrance into show business was as bold as his personality. He burst onto the scene in the MTV series <i>Undressed </i>as Eric, showing audiences that he had what it took to make it in Hollywood. His other early television credits include <i>Angel</i>, <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, and <i>Law & Order True Crime</i>. <a href=#>Jerry had small roles in films</a> such as the science fiction drama <i>Donnie Darko</i> and the cheerleader comedy <i>Bring It On Again</i>, which might not have grossed billions, but were still significant stepping stones in his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trainor's first recurring TV role was as Brian "the A.V. guy" on <i>Crossing Jordan</i>. However, it was his role as "Crazy" Steve on <i>Drake & Josh</i> that truly put him on the map. From there, he went on to star in <i>iCarly </i>as Spencer Shay, the lovable and goofy older brother of Miranda Cosgrove's title character. It's safe to say that Jerry's <a href=#>first steps into show business</a> were a success, and he's been making audiences laugh ever since.</p><h2 id=the-zenith-of-trainor-s-on-screen-achievements>The Zenith Of Trainor's On-Screen Achievements</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jerry Trainor kept pushing the creative envelope with his diverse range of roles. From commanding the microphone in the Halo in-universe podcast<i> Hunt the Truth</i> as Commander Michael Sullivan to lending his voice to the comical Commander Cone in <i>Bunsen Is a Beast</i>, he proved he could captivate audiences in any medium. Let's not forget his dynamic performance in <i>Cover Versions</i>, which was as edgy and thought-provoking as <a href=#>an Elon Musk tweet</a>. It's no wonder the film was picked up for distribution by Sony Pictures after it premiered at the 2018 Palm Springs Film Festival. With the release of <i>Snow Day</i> and his role as the Snowplow Man, Trainor's career continues to reach new heights.</p><p>However, it was his reprisal of the iconic role of Spencer Shay in the <i>iCarly </i>revival that cemented Trainor's position as a comedic genius. With his impeccable timing and delivery, Trainor had fans old and new laughing so hard that they may have needed oxygen tanks. The show's success was no surprise, and it's safe to say that Trainor's performance was worth more than a bucket of spaghetti tacos. <a href=#>And with his voice role</a> in an upcoming episode of<i> The Loud House</i> still to come, it seems Trainor's acting career has yet to reach its peak.

He's also a skilled musician who knows how to rock out on the bass guitar. In 2015, he joined forces with some equally talented friends to form the band Nice Enough People. Trainor's bass skills and Mike O'Gorman's guitar riffs are just a few of the <a href=#>things that make this band</a> worth listening to. Nice Enough People's music is more than just nice enough and their EP, <i>Hanover Hideaway</i>, which was released in 2016, is packed with upbeat, catchy tunes that will get your toes tapping and your head bopping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Trainor's bass driving the beat and Scagliotti's guitar adding a touch of grit, this band is a force to be reckoned with. Their live shows are equally impressive, and their tour schedule is packed with dates across the country. If you're a fan of Trainor's acting chops, you won't want to <a href=#>miss out on his musical talents</a>.</p><h2 id=trainor-s-impressive-collection-of-awards-and-honors>Trainor's Impressive Collection Of Awards And Honors</h2><p>Jerry Trainor has a collection of awards and nominations that would make anyone envious.
