It only seems natural that we follow the 90's clothing rebirth with the next decade of clothing as fashion has proven to be cyclical over time. Many iconic styles from the early 2000s have been slowly creeping their way back into people's wardrobes this year. Brightly-colored bucket hats and low-rise mini skirts have taken over many people's <a href=#>Tiktok</a> and Instagram feed this summer. All of the bold patterns, colors, and funky hairstyles may be bringing you back to one early 2000s fashion icon in particular, Lizzie McGuire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Noticed A 'Friends' Reference On 'Lizzie McGuire'</a></span></p><p>If you grew up in the early 2000s then you are aware of how influential the outfits worn by all the characters in the Lizzie McGuire show were at the time. The show aired for two seasons starting in 2001 and ended in 2004. Still to this day, <a href=#>Hilary Duff's character</a> seems to remain a major trendsetter in 2021. Celebrities are definitely jumping on the Y2K bandwagon this year with playful outfits and hairstyles that Lizzie McGuire would approve of. Here are 10 trends that celebs have been wearing these days that Lizzie McGuire would have worn in the early 2000s, without a doubt.</p><h2 id=low-rise-pants><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Low Rise Pants</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>High-waisted pants were not even a thought in the early 2000s. Low rise pants and mini-skirts were the go-to styles for bottoms which were usually seen accompanied by a chunky belt that had no functional purpose whatsoever. Lizzie was shown wearing a plethora of low-rise bottoms throughout the show, which has made its way back into the fashion world. Famous model, Bella Hadid has been seen rocking the low-rise pant trend on many occasions over the past couple of years. Bella posted a photo of herself wearing low-rise jeans paired with a cropped white tee and tan suede fur jacket, which especially looks like an outfit Lizzie McGuire would have worn.</p><h2 id=bucket-hats><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bucket Hats</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bucket hats of all kinds ranging from bright green ones to furry leopard ones have made a serious comeback this summer. Many celebrities were spotted in the streets or seen posting photos of themselves sporting this trend on Instagram. One celeb, in particular, has been seen many times topping off her outfits with a bucket hat. The multi-talented artist, businesswoman, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">newly announced billionaire</a>, Rihanna, seems to love the bucket hat trend. In the specific outfit pictured above, she paired her pink tank top and camo cargo pants with a matching pink bucket hat completing the look. Who knew we would be seeing this trend again that appeared many times in the Lizzie McGuire show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Rihanna Officially Becoming A Billionaire...But Not Through Her Music</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=butterfly-clips><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Butterfly Clips</span></h2><p>Lizzie made sure she showed up to middle school with the coolest hair accessories around. It is impossible to keep track of the number of times butterfly clips were worn in the show. These days they might as well be the main character of the outfit. This trend in particular has been seen all over Tiktok and Instagram with many influencers debuting their Y2K outfits. The popular <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiktok star</a>, Addison Rae, posted a photo on Instagram of herself wearing pink and orange butterfly clips to match her pink and orange tie-dye outfit. She had them styled the "Lizzie" way with some strands pulled out in the front.</p><h2 id=two-piece-matching-sets><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Two-Piece Matching Sets</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matching co-ords have had their comeback for a while now. However, they recently have been becoming more popular in bright colors and funky patterns giving off the early 2000s aesthetic. If you were a fan of Lizzie McGuire then you are more than aware of the two iconic green and silver matching sets from TheLizzie McGuire Movie, which have inspired many Halloween costumes since. Jorja Smith, the English R&B singer-songwriter, is photographed wearing an orange patterned matching co-ords set. What makes this matching set very Lizzie McGuire-esk is the bright bold color and funky Y2K pattern.</p><h2 id=fur-collars><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Fur Collars</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lizzie carried the fur collars 90s trend into her early 2000's middle school hallway and it has now made its way back into fashion decades later. English singer-songwriter, FKA Twigs, posted a photo on Instagram wearing a bright lime green fur-collared jacket. In the photo she sat next to fellow artist, Dua Lipa wearing a much less Y2K inspired outfit. Lizzie McGuire would definitely approve of the bright color on this fur collard jacket as she takes her colors very seriously on the show, "Gold? Just gold? It took me hours to mix this color last night, Gordo."</p><h2 id=space-buns><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Space Buns</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Queen of interesting hairstyles, Lizzie would never be caught with a boring ole hairstyle. She was always rocking two ponytails, low space buns, or a half up half down look with space buns. So many celebs have been spotted wearing space buns like Megan Thee Stallion, Olivia Rodrigo, and Hailey Baldwin just to name a few. The video above shows singer-songwriter, Rosalia wearing her hair in two space buns with purple hair ties to match her purple attire. She even had two little strands pulled out in front Y2K style.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>TikTokers Slam Olivia Rodrigo's Merch Saying It's 'Low Quality'</a></span></p><h2 id=mismatched-patterns><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mismatched Patterns</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lizzie and her best friend Miranda were 9 times out of 10 wearing an outfit with multiple patterns or layers. When you are having an "I have absolutely nothing to wear" and you cant choose between patterns, just wear them both in Lizzie fashion. The mismatched patterned stitch tops were a popular trend this year seen worn by many. R&B singer, SZA, seems to enjoy this trend as pictured above. On her Instagram, she posted a photo wearing one of these tops which Lizzie would have definitely worn back in the day.</p><h2 id=multiple-barrettes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Multiple Barrettes</span></h2><p>This trend has the ability to immediately transplant anyone who grew up in the early 2000s back in time. How many school photos included a bunch of colorful barrettes...too many to count. Reese Witherspoon's daughter, Ava Phillippe, looks like she is straight out of the Lizzie McGuire show in her Instagram photo above. Between the green face mask, bubble pink tank top, and colorful barrettes she could even pass as Lizzie herself. Other celebrities enjoy this trend as Lizzo, Dua Lipa, and Ariana Grande.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bold-colors-and-patterns><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bold Colors and Patterns</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Early 2000s fashion</a> was not afraid of color or adventure. Arguably some memorable fashion styles were questionable, like wearing dresses over jeans, but bold colors and patterns were too good to give up in 2021. Lizzie never shied away from wearing vibrant colors or patterns. The American singer, Halsey, encompasses all things Lizzie McGuire and Y2K in her Instagram photo from a couple of months ago. She has just about every color of the rainbow on including in her makeup and hair accessories. The vibrantly colored dress is even patterned and she wasn't afraid to add more color with her playful makeup and early 2000s hairstyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Celebrities Who Have Written Controversial Memoirs</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmquYnryvedOrnKeco2KwprjEm6pmmaKaerixwKugp59doba7xsieZKabl6q2s7GMrKuaqqSasW7DzqucZp2Rp7m6eZFpZ2mrXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f9-fashion-trends-celebs-are-wearing-now-that-lizzie-mcguire-wore-in-the-early-2000s.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alana-thompson-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alana-thompson-net-worth-therichest.html>Alana Thompson Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./20-images-that-prove-camila-cabello-is-clearly-the-next-jlo.html>20 Images That Prove Camila Cabello Is Clearly The Next JLo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./20-images-that-prove-camila-cabello-is-clearly-the-next-jlo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
