She has won a number of honors, including four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award.</p><p>She was included among the top 100 influential persons in the world by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Time magazine</a> in 2019.</p><p>Due to Regina King’s support for the LGBTQ community and her large homosexual fan following, many people have long believed that she is gay.</p><p>So, is Regina King really gay? Or are these rumors just baseless? Let’s not waste time and dive into the article to discover the truth about Actress’ sexuality.</p><h2>Is Regina King Gay?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/19-Regina-King-1200x834-1.jpg alt="is regina king gay" width=1200 height=834 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>No, Regina King is not gay.&nbsp;</strong>Due to Regina King’s continuous support and involvement with the LGBTQ community, many people believe her to be gay.</p><p>She spoke openly about her experiences and opinions during an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Logo TV</a>, emphasizing her sincere connection and concern for the&nbsp;community.</p><p>In addition, she pledged in 2021 to aggressively <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engage non-binary talent</a> in her trailblazing initiatives to promote diversity in the film business after winning the coveted Golden Globe award.</p><p>But it’s important to admit the truth: Regina King has only ever dated males, which is a clear hint that she identifies as straight, according to her dating history.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Diane Keaton Gay?

The actor, who was formerly married, hasn’t been associated with anyone in the media since 2013.</p><p>Although she occasionally dates, Regina <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said to the New York Post</a> in 2019 that she is just too busy to be in a committed relationship.</p><p>“People ask you if you’re dating anyone,” she remarked. “I mean, I’m dating, but where I am right now is quite comfortable. I’m not prepared for being in an uncomfortable situation by interfering with it.</p><p>Everything we do know about Regina’s past relationships, including what happened with her ex-husband, is detailed here.</p><h3 class="body-h4 css-n3df7t et3p2gv0" data-node-id=2>Ian Alexander (1994 to 2007)</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/41828-16428712814197-1920.webp alt="is regina king gay" width=1543 height=913 sizes="(max-width: 1543px) 100vw, 1543px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The longest-lasting and most well-known relationship Regina has had was with record producer Ian Alexander, her ex-husband.</p><p>They originally connected in the early 1990s, and after a few years of dating, they gave birth to Ian Jr., their one and only child, in 1996.</p><p>They got married the next year, but after over ten years of marriage, they chose to divorce in 2007.</p><p>Regina and Ian got along considerably better as co-parents and friends than as husband and wife, as she subsequently argued in a 2020 article that published in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Essence</a>.</p><p>I enjoy the trip because it led my ex and I back to a friendship that helped us become amazing co-parents, she added, adding that it’s sort of weird to think that I’ve now been divorced for longer than I was married.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ian Jr. sadly passed away in January 2022</a>. After the passing of their son, it’s unknown where Regina and Ian Sr. stand, but let’s hope they can still rely on one another for support.</p><p><strong>Must Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Judge Judy Gay?

To be prepared for each other now, we each had to take whatever action was necessary.</p><p>Sadly, the relationship didn’t endure, and after only nearly two years of dating, breakup rumors began to surface in March 2013.</p><p>He claimed to no longer be feeling it, a source informed. Regina didn’t address the claims at the time, but it appears that Malcolm may have ended their relationship unfavorably.</p><p>Regina was asked about the finest Valentine’s Day gift she’d ever received in a 2015 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Us Weekly</a>. Regina responded, “That’s tough because I don’t have one—someone broke up with me on Valentine’s.” Um??</p><p>She claims that the ex even gave her flowers that said, “I still love you,” and although she didn’t mention Malcolm by name, it certainly appears like he is the alleged sender.</p><p>Later the same year, Malcolm <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>, “Thank u 4 representing & affirming that integrity dignity & success CAN coexist!” in response to Regina’s historic Emmy win for her part in American Crime. So I think he doesn’t harbor any grudges?</p><p>Whether or whether she stays unmarried, Regina will continue to succeed both on and off the screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2K%2FprPIp5hmo5mjtG6zwLJmbGhlZ4Fw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-regina-king-gay-supporting-the-lgbtq-community-sparks-speculations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-and-brad-pitt-s-candid-shirtless-photos-drew-opposite-reactions-from-fans.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-and-brad-pitt-s-candid-shirtless-photos-drew-opposite-reactions-from-fans.html>Leonardo DiCaprio And Brad Pitt's Candid Shirtless Photos Drew Opposite Reactions From Fans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./angie-gutierrez-who-is-rey-mysterio-s-wife.html>Angie Gutierrez: Who Is Rey Mysterios Wife?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./angie-gutierrez-who-is-rey-mysterio-s-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
