There will always be 'new kids on the block,' in Hollywood; every once in a while a new actor or actress will seemingly come out of nowhere, give a stunning performance which earns them a spot in our cultural conversation, and 25-year-old Dacre Montgomery is one such example of a newcomer who dazzled fans with an incredibly memorable breakout performance we couldn't stop talking about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2017 was an important role for not only pop culture fans, but for Dacre Montgomery, himself. Time seemed to stop for Montgomery as he was cast in two monumental projects many would dream to land, much less right out the gate! One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">role</a> was for a film adaptation of one legendary franchise, which coincidentally was a staple during the decade in which the television show Montgomery landed for the second role of his eventful year, takes place in. Longtime fans of the Power Rangers were introduced to Dacre Montgomery when he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cast in the big-screen adaptation</a> as the Red Ranger.</p><p>Montgomery's second notable role was a role which would showcase the range of his acting ability while also propelling him into a heartthrob status in some circles when he was cast as Billy Hargrove, the resident 'bad boy' of Hawkins, Indiana, in the second season of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></strong>'s break-out hit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things</a>.&nbsp;Billy was a complex character; he was mysterious, with the tendency to lash out at everyone he encountered, but as the series progresses, fans learn there are intricate layers to Billy, that extended past his good looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 BTS Pics From Netflix's Stranger Things That Are More Adorable Than Creepy</a></span></p><h2 id=dacre-knows-his-craft>Dacre Knows His Craft</h2><p>We've heard the saying 'There's a method to the 'madness' when it comes to nailing or creating a craft in the arts. Acting clearly became instrumental for Dacre Montgomery where he discovered he had a knack for the craft, so he was lead to make acting a top priority, and he has been extremely candid when explaining his process. Montgomery's Stranger Things character requires a lot of intricate preparation, and he knows exactly how&nbsp;to&nbsp;get in touch with playing Billy.</p><p>Getting into Billy's head and nailing every element of his character is a top priority; In order to master the tone of and nature of Stranger Things, Montgomery works very hard to make sure he is aware of every factor around him and makes his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">co-stars</a> a top priority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> with Independent, Montgomery gets along very well with his co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie Bobby Brown</a> with whom he shared an important plotline with, in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third season</a> of the show. The pair work well together because Montgomery knows he needs to put "150%" into his performance, and he notes Brown is the same way; She is "Emotionally mature," and the duo are able to "Talk about things" when they are preparing for scenes together.</p><p>Montgomery's sense of drive is also reflected in his belief he does not feel like he belongs on the sets of his projects and points to his nervous nature for these seemingly negative feelings, but there is an upside to being aware of his nerves. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>, "I kind of have this thing of, 'I don't deserve to be here.' There's 50,000 people behind me, and that's what drives me to work harder..." This feeling hasn't always been present for him, and he can attribute a feeling of being content on set, and it can be attributed to his breakout role. He added, "I've really had that one moment in my career where I walked on set, and I was like 'I deserve to be here.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things: Everything We Know About The Cast Before The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=dacre-behind-the-scenes>Dacre: Behind-The-Scenes</h2><p>Seriousness isn't the only quality to Dacre Montgomery! The Stranger Things star is able to step out of his serious and focused nature in his personal life.</p><p>His character Billy is sometimes perceived as a heartthrob, and this quality transcends off-screen, too! Billy Hargrove is spoken for, IRL: he has been in a serious relationship for quite a while with the same woman. Liv Pollock is the lucky lady, and she and her man perhaps set themselves up for success, because of their sweet connection! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to</a>Elite Daily, "The two met because they ran in the same professional circles in Australia."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo took their love coastal around the time Montgomery landed his first role in Stranger Things, providing them with both huge milestones both professionally and personally! Pollock left Australia and traveled with her man to Atlanta where he was filming the show, and they bought their first nest together. The couple revealed via Elite Daily, they spent lots of time going to "Homeware stores, shopping," because they are both fans of designing and adding their own personal touches to their nest egg.</p><p>As illustrated in Montgomery's steadfast commitment to his roles, it works for him to have a personal connection within which he can contribute to his performance. The transition from growing up in Perth, Australia, to finding his place in the entertainment industry was not always an easy feat. In response to his Stranger Things' character's nature to act out and bully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the younger kids</a>, Montgomery channeled experiences from his younger days. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">candid interview</a>, he explained the process of finding himself did not happen while he was at the age of the Stranger Things crew, but later on. He revealed, "[School] is not everything, and I didn't find who I was, and that's okay, and I sort of found it when I left, and sort of got to pursue the dream I had constantly wanted to pursue since primary school and high school."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's rare to find a celebrity so candid and open with expressing themselves, showing exactly who they are to the public, and whose self-assurance will take him far throughout his career. Whether or not Dacre Montgomery will go on to star in more giant roles or not, fans can rest assure he will never lose himself in the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Facts About Stranger Things' Natalia Dyer</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmpuimnquu82tnqillafGbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V50Z6YpWWcnrOmedKtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq12YtaK%2BwJyrnqpf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-what-stranger-things-actor-dacre-montgomery-is-like-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-callum-tarren-meet-the-golf-player-s-wife-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-callum-tarren-meet-the-golf-player-s-wife-family.html>Who Is Callum Tarren?
