Singer, CEO, fashion designer, reality show personality, mom, model, influencer...all these are on her nameplate, and with all those streams of income, she's definitely not pinching pennies. The country star has amassed a $10 million net worth since she first released her self-titled debut album in 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>From Fish Pedicures To Bird Facials: 15 Celebrity Beauty Treatments</a></span></p><p>She and her husband <strong>Eric Decker</strong>, a former <strong>NFL</strong> wide receiver most notably with the Denver Broncos, starred in a reality show&nbsp;<strong>Eric & Jessie: Game On</strong>, and they never slowed down after that. Her Instagram portrays a life so idyllic it seems like a fairytale. Between vacations to exotic destinations, she starts a new company virtually every year, throws lavish parties for family and friends, and spoils her kids with gifts and outings...and <a href=#>looks fantastic</a> doing all of it. Here's how she spends her $10 million net worth.</p><h2 id=extravagant-vacations><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Extravagant Vacations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If&nbsp;you had a $10 million net worth, you'd be going on extravagant vacations too! Jessie James Decker's Instagram is teeming with pictures of her <a href=#>luxurious escapades</a> with her husband and their children - and those places aren't cheap! Most recently, the family traveled to Italy, where they explored Tuscany, Positano, and more. The trip <a href=#>ruffled some feathers</a>, though; fans were outraged when Jessie posted pictures from an airplane full of people,&nbsp;all of them unmasked.</p><h2 id=facials-body-contouring-and-other-medical-spa-treatments><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Facials, Body Contouring, And Other Medical Spa Treatments</span></h2><p>We seem to be in a new era where more and more celebrities are being transparent about their cosmetic procedures and medical spa treatments, so that's...improvement? We guess? Jessie James Decker isn't shy about putting her medical spa treatments all over her grid. She's gotten Flexsure, a body contouring treatment, and Oxygeneo, a skin tightening super-facial that costs about $200 per session.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wild-parties><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Wild Parties</span></h2><p>Just because Jessie James Decker is a mom, that doesn't stop her from partying, and her throwdowns&nbsp;put some of the Real Housewives' parties to shame. She recently threw a "13 Going On 30" party for her sister Sydney Rae Bass, a blogger and fellow influencer at Southern Girl City Lights. Sydney Rae had previously appeared on&nbsp;Eric and Jessie: Game On, which is how her now-fiancee spotted her and tracked her down to ask her out.</p><h2 id=a-high-end-personal-trainer><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A High-End Personal Trainer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessie James Decker's trainer doesn't come cheap. Kevin Klug of Klug Fitness is also the personal trainer to Bachelor Nation's Kaitlyn Bristowe, country star Jameson Rogers, and a host of other celebs. At 3 or 4 workouts a week, Jessie James Decker is likely shelling out more per week than your rent.</p><h2 id=super-bowl-tickets><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Super Bowl Tickets</span></h2><p>There are some perks to having a former NFL player for a husband. Sporting a jersey that read "Mrs. Decker," Jessie James Decker attended the Super Bowl with her husband, former Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker. Eric has since retired, having spent four years with the Broncos, three with the New York Jets, and a minute with the Tennessee Titans, but his Instagram shows he's never too far from the game and brings his family to NFL games regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Drama Between Jessie James Decker And Her Brother Explained</a></span></p><h2 id=gorgeous-meals><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Gorgeous Meals</span></h2><p>Jessie James Decker's book&nbsp;Just Feed Me: Simply Delicious Recipes from My Heart to Your Plate&nbsp;is <a href=#>a New York Times bestseller</a>, and her Instagram is a pretty compelling advertisement for her food. The book has <a href=#>classic hearty meals</a> like spaghetti and meatballs, but also features holiday-specific meals like an Easter candy chocolate bar, and kid-friendly treats like strawberry yogurt popsicles.</p><h2 id=glitzy-outfits><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Glitzy Outfits</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter where the country star goes, she's always looking glitzy in high fashion. She even has her own clothing line, Kittenish, which prides itself on its "fun, flirty, playful and sassy" aesthetic. At about $60 for most dresses in the clothing line, it's definitely not cheap...but it's not as costly as some of her own looks. While in Greece recently, she bought two Santorini Dress gowns for herself and her daughter. Not only are they over $200, they are made especially for extravagant photoshoots.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Jessie James Decker Recipes You Need To Jump On If You Havenâ€™t Already</a></span></p><h2 id=over-the-top-seasonal-decorations><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Over-The-Top Seasonal Decorations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Neighbors of Jessie James Decker's gorgeous Nashville house will always know what time of year it is: her house is always decked out in over-the-top seasonal decorations. With a changing rotation of Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, and all the rest, these decorations have got to be running them up bill. When your net worth is $10 million, your house can be as festive as you want!</p><h2 id=popping-bottles-pretty-much-whenever><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Popping Bottles...Pretty Much Whenever</span></h2><p>You can't scroll more than a few times down her Instagram grid without finding Jessie James Decker with a drink in her hand. The mom, CEO, and country star pops bottles of champagne to celebrate just about anything. She doesn't discriminate, though; she's also frequently drinking margaritas, wine, you name it. One bottle of white wine in a recent photo, Stay Gold pinot grigio, clocks in at $286 a bottle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adorable-family-outings><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Adorable Family Outings</span></h2><p>Jessie James Decker's and Eric Decker's three kids seemingly have a pretty idyllic life.
