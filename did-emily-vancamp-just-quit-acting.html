After landing memorable roles in dramas like Everwood (where <a href=#>she met and dated Chris Pratt</a>) and Brothers & Sisters, she ultimately rose to fame after getting the lead role in the ABC thriller drama Revenge. Just a few years later, the Canadian actress also made her mark in film after making her debut in the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</a> as Sharon Carter.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Emily VanCamp's Family Sends Her Hate Mail</a></span>Since then, VanCamp has starred in various MCU films, as well as the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. In between her Marvel projects, the actress also worked on a couple of films and the medical drama The Resident. Recently, however, VanCamp decided to exit the medical drama. At the same time, the actress may have also hinted that she was going quit acting for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emily-vancamp-decided-she-wouldn-rsquo-t-return-to-lsquo-the-resident-rsquo-after-having-her-first-child>Emily VanCamp Decided She Wouldn’t Return To ‘The Resident’ After Having Her First Child</h2><p>Long before The Resident’s fifth season got underway, it knew that VanCamp, one of its lead stars and producers, will not be present for some time. Around the time that the show was finishing its fourth season, they learned that <a href=#>the actress was expecting her first child</a> with husband (and Revenge co-star) Josh Bowman.</p><p>That’s when they knew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wouldn’t be back on set anytime soon</a>. “So because we’re all capable of arithmetic, we sort of saw when she would be delivering, and it was the opening of the season,” Peter Elkoff, the show’s executive producer, explained. “We knew that she wasn’t going to be in anything in the beginning because it became clear that her life was taking a new turn.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while VanCamp could have just easily taken a long maternity leave, the actresses decided to exit the medical drama instead. “We had lots of conversations about it. We gradually came to understand through our communication that it was the end of the road for The Resident and Emily,” Elkoff revealed. “We were all sad but totally respected her wishes and her desire to focus on family, so we adjusted our plans.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Notice Differences In Wanda's Room Between 'WandaVision' and 'Captain America: Civil War'</a></span></p><p>The co-showrunner also admitted that eventually, they realized that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there was no other option but to kill VanCamp’s Nicolette ‘Nic’ Nevin off</a> in season 5. “It just felt like, to preserve this fictional character as alive in this fictional universe, it would create immense logic problems,” Elkoff explained. “Why would she a) leave the hospital, b) leave Conrad [Matt Czuchry], c) leave her daughter? None of it made any logical sense for us. Also, doing what we did is the thing that packs an emotional punch.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Czuchry also agreed that having Nic die was the best way to end the story arc they shared. “Having the Conrad and Nic relationship come to a full conclusion was essential,” the actor said. “It needed to be that way because we couldn’t have the audience wishing or hoping that there was something out there that could happen between Conrad and Nic, because that doesn’t allow the characters to grow and change.”</p><p>Ultimately, VanCamp herself felt like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nic’s story wrapped up just as it should have</a>. “Nic had a very beautiful life. And as tragic as it is the way she goes, her ending is very fitting and representative of the person that she was,” the actress remarked. “I’m glad they went that route with the character, she leaves quite the legacy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-emily-vancamp-really-quit-acting>Did Emily VanCamp Really Quit Acting?</h2><p>Sure, actors have decided to exit shows in the past (some were killed off too). However, perhaps what makes VanCamp’s exit from The Resident stand out is that there is no word on what the actress will be doing next. She’s also admitted that her “priorities shifted.”</p><p>“I think there comes a moment in every woman’s life—in every person’s life—where it becomes less about work and more about family, and that’s what happened while I was making the show,” VanCamp explained. “Doing that many episodes in a different city and then you add Covid to that, most of us couldn’t see our families for almost a year. It really solidified for me that family is where my heart is at the moment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anthony Mackie Says ‘Opposites Attract’ In ‘The Falcon And The Winter Soldier’</a></span></p><p>Now, it seems that VanCamp may no longer be keen on doing episodic projects (which was how she started out in Hollywood). Nonetheless, there are certain projects that the actress would be willing to come out of ‘semi-retirement’ for. She may prefer to spend more time at home with her family, but VanCamp would still take a call from Marvel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“One thing I’ve learned from working with Marvel all these years is we can never speak on anything,” the actress explained. “I absolutely love working for Marvel and I love Sharon, she’s so much fun to play.” So far, Marvel hasn’t said when fans will see Sharon Carter again. That said, there was an intriguing reveal regarding Sharon in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Was Linda Cardellini Before Becoming Laura Barton In The MCU?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmrqquNhmrZqmk5a6sXnJrqqtZaGqtrV5wJyroqaXZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-emily-vancamp-just-quit-acting.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-taylor-swift-save-brittany-mahomes-tarnished-image.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-taylor-swift-save-brittany-mahomes-tarnished-image.html>Did Taylor Swift Save Brittany Mahomes' Tarnished Image?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./daniel-sahad-passed-away-at-29-cause-of-death-of-the-nan%C3%A9-vocalist-explored.html>Daniel Sahad Passed Away At 29- Cause Of Death Of The Nan Vocalist Explored</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./daniel-sahad-passed-away-at-29-cause-of-death-of-the-nan%C3%A9-vocalist-explored.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
