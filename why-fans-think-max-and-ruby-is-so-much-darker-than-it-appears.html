After all, it’s these shows that help form them as children and teach them plenty of important life lessons through colorful characters and entertaining adventures. One of the longest-running kids’ TV shows of recent years has been the series Max and Ruby, which stars the titular cute and cuddly bunnies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fans of the series have begun to realize how odd it was -- asking questions about Max and Ruby including where their parents are and why Max never speaks. They soon thought that the TV show is so much darker than it appears, and here’s why!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of The Most Famous Animal Actors, And Where You Know Them From</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-believe-max-and-ruby-killed-their-own-parents>Fans Believe Max And Ruby Killed Their Own Parents</h2><p>Throughout the overwhelming majority of the show’s run, fans never see the rabbit’s parents. They aren’t in the series at all. Naturally, many would deduce that it has something to do with the fact that the TV show revolves around the misadventures the little bunnies embark on their own little playtimes.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is a show intended for the children – so it isn’t a big deal if it doesn’t involve the parents. People point that the urn featured in the rabbits’ home contains the ashes of Max and Ruby’s parents. Some then claim that the two bunnies were playing silly games and having misadventures to forget about the fact that their folks died in an accident.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan wrote, “My mom just said ruby from max&ruby killed her parents while drunk driving and that’s why she has to take care of max.” Another commented, “Max and ruby must be crazy and killed their parents.”</p><p>Others say that it was the creepy kids who killed them, or it was the silent Max who pulled off the crime. One tweeted, “Max from Max and Ruby def killed both his parents I could always tell by his face.” Another wrote, “The more I see of Max and Ruby the more convinced I am Max killed their parents.”</p><p>While these theories seem interesting and believable, none of them are true. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The show’s creator provided an explanation</a> behind the reason why the parents were never seen in the series. Rosemary Wells revealed, “We don’t see Max and Ruby’s parents because I believe that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they’re on their own.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wells added, “The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way.” <a href=#>Nickelodeon, who offered a myriad of popular TV shows</a>, finally featured the rabbits’ parents after five seasons and 14 years of the show – putting to rest the theory that the two rabbits are murderers. The bunnies’ parents showed up in the picture in season 6, which aired in 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘The Simpsons’ Animation Looks So Different Now</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-believe-max-couldn-rsquo-t-talk-properly-due-to-trauma>Fans Believe Max Couldn’t Talk Properly Due To Trauma</h2><p>Many have long since wondered about why Max never speaks in the show. Over the years, fans have begun asking why the three-year-old bunny only utters few words, and most of the time, he is silent. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A number of fan theories have emerged about it</a>, offering up suggestions based on their observations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One theory suggests that Max was injured in a car accident, where his parents died. It apparently left him only able to speak in short sentences. Another fan theory points out that Max’s grandmother, who can be seen throughout the series, may have abused him and that the trauma of such violence may have left him too scared to speak.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hugh Hefner Shocked Everyone With His Cameo On This Iconic Animation</a></span></p><p>Throughout most of the show, Max didn’t talk. He was a quiet toddler, but as the series progressed, he did talk using short words and phrases. The reason for Max’s speaking could be due to him growing up. It is something that has changed as he has grown and his parents are already around to support him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan tweeted, “Since Max and Ruby is trending, let me inform everyone that ever since the show was recently, Max can now speak full sentences and their parents are now on the show.” What a great comeback on the TV screens, debunking all the dark fan theories about the cute little bunnies.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Netflix offers a new animated series from the creator of Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup</a> – the well-known kids’ TV show, The Powerpuff Girls. The series, Kid Cosmic, is a ten-episode run that follows the adventure of an imaginative and enthusiastic boy becoming a superhero.</p><p>This could be a great show for those who love adventures and animations, like Max and Ruby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Anime Movie That Nearly Destroyed Disney Animation</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBuucCxZKatpJp6qrqMppixZZGjsW6%2B1JuwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-fans-think-max-and-ruby-is-so-much-darker-than-it-appears.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./raiders-fan-socked-in-face-in-violent-fistfight-at-chargers-game.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./raiders-fan-socked-in-face-in-violent-fistfight-at-chargers-game.html>Raiders Fan Socked In Face In Violent Fistfight At Chargers Game</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-won-crime-scene-kitchen.html>Who won crime scene kitchen</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-won-crime-scene-kitchen.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
