The star first gained prominence after he had made many appearances on his parents' show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, as a child.</p><p>While Chaz also followed in his parents' footsteps by taking on a career in music and acting, the star made headlines in 2009 when it was revealed that he would be transitioning and living his life as authentically as possible. The star had Cher's support throughout, as well as their millions of fans across the world.</p><p>In the years since transitioning, Chaz has continued to work in the entertainment industry, and in addition to his acting roles, Chaz he's also featured in a number of reality shows as himself, including his own TV show, Being Chaz, on the Oprah Network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's safe to say, then, that Chaz's professional life has been fairly steady. However, over the past several years, he's been just as successful in his personal life. Chaz began dating his partner, Shara Mathes, back in 2017. So, who is Chaz's love, and how did they meet? Let's find out!</p><p><strong>Updated in September 2023: </strong>Both Chaz and Shara have been relatively quiet about their relationship via social media in 2023, with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chaz's last post of them together</a> back in January. However, that doesn't mean these two aren't still in a relationship. Au contraire, when it comes to posts tagging them, it's clear they're very much an item. In late September, the two were snapped at a birthday dinner for Shara. What's more, the month prior, Shara had shared a pic with another friend, drawing attention to Chaz's latest film, 'Bury the Bride'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-chaz-bono-amp-shara-mathes-meet>How Did Chaz Bono & Shara Mathes Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shara-blue-mathes-and-chaz-bono.jpg><p>Chaz Bono has been in the spotlight since childhood, mainly due to <a href=# rel=nofollow>who his parents are and all the drama that surrounded them</a>. The star was born to none other than Sonny and Cher, two of the music industry's most recognized names to date. Chaz would routinely make appearances on his parents' show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, which is where fans were first introduced to the up-and-coming musician himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cher "Only" Averaged $6 Million Per Year Throughout Her Career, But It All Adds Up</a></span></p><p>Chaz would go on to make international headlines in 2008 when it was revealed that he was transgender. Considering Chaz lived his early life as a female<strong>,</strong> and in the public eye, when the star underwent his transition in 2009<strong>,</strong> his journey was documented in a two-part special with Entertainment Tonight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news rocked the world, as the overall view on transgender people was far less progressive than it is today. Despite the hardships, however, Chaz persevered as his authentic self and featured in a number of reality TV shows that brought attention to his experience, as well as several film and TV roles, including among others American Horror Story.</p><p>With that being said, Bono is now focused on his relationship with his partner, Shara Blue Mathes<strong>.</strong> The duo first met back in 2017 and have been going strong ever since. Our question remains, though: just how did these lovebirds meet in the first place?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, according to Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the duo first met through mutual friends</a>, and it's likely they bonded over their Hollywood upbringing. Much like Chaz, Shara Mathes also entered the entertainment business from a young age after appearing oppopsite Jason Bateman in the 1984 series, It's Your Move.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Where Is Chaz Bono Today, And How Much Is He Worth?</a></span></p><p>Though neither party has been particularly forthcoming with details, a source close to Chaz and Shara revealed that, "Shara was newly single when she first met Chaz, and she wasn't looking for love."</p><p>So, what changed? According to the insider, Chaz's personality had everything to do with it.</p><p>"Chaz is such a charming, funny guy that Shara soon fell for him," the source gushed. The duo has since traveled the world together, and even attended many a Cher event arm in arm, making it clear that they are quite the team!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-cher-think-of-shara>What Does Cher Think Of Shara?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shara-blue-mathes-and-cher.jpg><p>In addition to Chaz and Shara being happier than ever, Cher and her mom, Georgia, are also head over heels happy for the couple, and reportedly consider Shara to be "like family." It only makes sense, then, that back in 2019, Shara shared via Instagram that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cher signed cards to her as being from her, "Mother in law (basically)."</a></p><p>On the topic of mothers in law and wedding bells, one other thing we know is that Cher would give the couple her blessing to tie the knot, wholeheartedly. In fact, while Shara was still in the midst of her divorce from now-ex-husband, Jason Mathes, Cher was said to be devastated. Per National Enquirer, all she wanted at the time was to see the two walk down the aisle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, her divorce was finalized. However, two years on, the two have yet to tie the knot, and no engagement has been announced, either. Granted, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chaz may be a little hesitant to share updates</a> in that department, since his previous engagement was broken off after a televised proposal.</p><p>Whether or not they will remains to be seen - however, one thing we do know for sure is that Cher would be thrilled if they did.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>This Is Chaz Bono's Acting Career</a></span></p><p>Although things have been going well, fans have been a little speculative when it comes to Shara and Chaz's relationship. The last time Shara shared an image of herself with Chaz to Instagram was back in December 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in honor of, "The Christmas that almost wasn't."</a> She'd faced cancer earlier that year -- and there's a good chance that played a role in her taking a step back from sharing pics with her uber-famous partner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether or not Shara's health had anything to do with it, her and Chaz' low-key approach to social media could also just mean the couple aren't sharing as much with the world, and are opting instead to keep that all for themselves. After a lifetime of Chaz's every move being dissected by the press, we'd have to say that's fair enough!</p><p>We're wishing these two the best, whatever the future holds for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur8easWaan6O8tHnPmqmtppWnerS0wKuYZpqcqrJuucCtn56rXZa7pXnHqK5mnJmZerW0xLJkpp2VqXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-chaz-bono-s-partner-shara-blue-mathes-and-how-did-they-meet.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./scream-vii-what-to-know-after-melissa-barrera-jenna-ortega-s-exits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./scream-vii-what-to-know-after-melissa-barrera-jenna-ortega-s-exits.html>'Scream VII': What to Know After Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega's Exits</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./todd-hoffman-net-worth-therichest.html>Todd Hoffman Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./todd-hoffman-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
