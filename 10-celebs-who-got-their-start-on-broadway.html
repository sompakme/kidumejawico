While they may not all have stayed in the world of theater, these celebrities made their acting debuts through the brightest and best - Broadway itself. Whether soaking up the applause at the Gershwin Theater or starting strong in the West End before hitting it big in America, these stars all proudly started on the stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker-started-small><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Sarah Jessica Parker Started Small</span></h2><p>Long before her iconic starring role as Carrie Bradshaw in<a href=#> Sex and the City</a>, Sarah Jessica Parker brought love and laughter to audiences from a spotlight on stage. The actress kick-started her career when she<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> joined the Broadway debut </a>of The Innocents at age 11. While her career grew alongside her as she aged away from the stage and onto the screen, her passion for live performance remains and she returned to the stage with her husband Matthew Broderick to bring Plaza Suite back to Broadway in 2022.</p><h2 id=jason-alexander-joined-the-crew-of-jerome-robbins-rsquo-broadway><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jason Alexander Joined The Crew Of Jerome Robbins’ Broadway</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jason Alexander made himself a household name and face through the sitcom Seinfeld, his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">career actually took off on stage</a> years before. In 1981, Alexander joined the cast of Merrily We Roll Along, taking to the stage immediately. His performance in Jerome Robbins’ Broadway brought him home a Tony, just in time for him to join the cast of Seinfeld to win over the rest of America as George Costanza.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did 'Seinfeld' Ruin Jason Alexander's Career?</a></span></p><h2 id=meryl-streep-shone-on-stage><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Meryl Streep Shone On Stage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julliard-trained Meryl Streep has<a href=#> always glowed in her performances</a>, bringing the most intricate details to the screen, so it’s no wonder her talents have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also shone on stage</a>. Prior to killing it on the screen, Streep stepped up on Broadway with Trelawny of the Wells in 1975. It only took one year (and a switch over to joining 27 Wagons Full of Cotton) to win her a Tony. Of course, her Tony is now joined by three Oscars and multiple Golden Globes, as Streep’s amazing career has persisted.</p><h2 id=diane-keaton-networked-from-the-stage><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Diane Keaton Networked From The Stage</span></h2><p>Known popularly for her work in Annie Hall, Father of the Bride, and Something’s Gotta Give, Diane Keaton wasn’t always that cool and quirky figure on screen that the public came to love. Her career actually kicked off with a performance as an understudy in Hair. Of course, being in the background wasn’t her thing forever and, within a year,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she was starring in Play It Again, Sam</a> with Woody Allen. The two got together in 1972 to make the Tony-nominated play into a film and her career took off after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-earl-jones-earned-a-solid-3-5><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Earl Jones Earned A Solid 3/5</span></h2><p>Widely known for his voice work in Star Wars and The Lion King, James Earl Jones’ career has spanned a wide variety of genres and forms. While he became a popular figure on screen, the actor actually started out on Broadway in 1957 with Sunrise at Campobello. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He’s frequented the stage</a>, nominated for a total of five Tony awards, winning three of the five and actually won a Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theater in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Thought James Earl Jones Passed Away When He Was Still Very Much Alive</a></span></p><h2 id=nick-jonas-was-burning-up-on-stage><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nick Jonas Was Burning Up On Stage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before hitting it big in the Jonas Brothers or on Disney Channel, Nick Jonas heated up the stage from a young age. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cast on Broadway at only 7 years old</a>, the singer joined the casts of Les Misérables, Beauty and the Beast, and Annie Get Your Gun. He stepped away from the stage of theater and turned that success into a career in music and film. The singer returned to theater briefly in 2012, but has since chosen to focus on music and<a href=#> spend time with family</a> including his wife Priyanka Chopra and their new daughter.</p><h2 id=viola-davis-took-time-for-her-tony><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Viola Davis Took Time For Her Tony</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Widely recognized for her role in How to Get Away with Murder, Viola Davis has a wide career full of diverse roles and platforms. Her first steps into the limelight actually came off-Broadway in a 1992 production of As You Like It. The actress took four years to make it to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> starring on Broadway in Seven Guitars</a>, and it was another five years until her 2001 role in King Hedley II would win her that Tony. Though it took some time, she’s since won an Oscar, Golden Globe, and SAG Award to join the collection.</p><h2 id=gaten-matarazzo-gave-the-audience-a-reason-to-smile><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Gaten Matarazzo Gave The Audience A Reason To Smile</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The youngest on this list, Gaten Matarazzo spun straight from the stage into the cult classic Stranger Things, cementing himself as a fan favorite within minutes. While his character Dustin is adored on screen, Matarazzo actually started off singing his way into hearts as Gavroche in Les Misérables in 2014. Matarrazo returned to Broadway in 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joining the cast of Dear Evan Hansen</a> as Jared Kleinman. Co-Stranger Things stars Sadie Sink and Caleb McLoughlin also kickstarted their careers on Broadway, making that child cast a triple threat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gaten Matarazzo's Amazing Transformation Since Stranger Things Season 1</a></span></p><h2 id=morgan-freeman-debuted-with-dolly><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Morgan Freeman Debuted With Dolly</span></h2><p>Few actors are as revered among critics and fans as Morgan Freeman. His iconic and recognizable voice seems to soothe the crowds and the casting director of Hello, Dolly! apparently agreed. The actor set up on stage in 1968, joining the crew for an<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> all-Black version of the classic musical</a> on Broadway. It didn’t take long for him to move from the stage to the screen when he started winning the hearts of millions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julie-andrews-brought-west-end-charm><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Julie Andrews Brought West End Charm</span></h2><p>One of the iconic actors that many admire, Julie Andrews’ charm has always come across to the audience. First starting her career in England, the actress began as a child and started her time acting on the West End. Her charisma seemed to beckon to all, leading to her move to New York in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1954 to star in The Boy Friend</a>. The actress quickly found a role in My Fair Lady as Eliza Doolittle, leading to rave reviews<a href=#> that interested Walt Disney</a>. It didn’t take long for her to hit the right notes with Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, cementing herself into culture for the decades that followed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZKCnpGLBqbHIq2SsrJGnwW67zWaZq6eRmcSixY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-got-their-start-on-broadway.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-clancy-parents-raised-him-in-los-angeles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bachelor-in-paradise-aaron-clancy-parents-raised-him-in-los-angeles.html>Bachelor In Paradise Aaron Clancy Parents Raised Him In Los Angeles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./troy-trevor-tulowitzki-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html>Troy Trevor Tulowitzki Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./troy-trevor-tulowitzki-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
