Bautista started his career as a bodybuilder, earning stipends as a nightclub bouncer and lifeguard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bautista recalled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the moment he decided to pursue a career in wrestling</a>; he asked a coworker to lend him money so he could buy Christmas presents for his children, and broke down in tears.</p><p>Dave Bautista began his professional wrestling career in 1999. He wrestled for several independent organizations before signing with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. Like butter through a hot knife, Bautista rose through the ranks of WWE, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winning his first world championship</a> against fellow wrestler Triple H on April 3rd, 2005.</p><p>The championship launched Bautista to new heights; he went on to win the championship six more times, and added two WWE Championships to his list of titles. "Animal Bautista" (as his WWE fans dubbed him) was paid a yearly compensation of $813,000 in WWE as of 2004; the payment was later increased to $840,000 after he signed new contracts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=transition-to-hollywood>Transition To Hollywood</h2><p>Before Bautista fully moved over to Hollywood, he guest-starred in several television shows as himself. He appeared in season six of Smallville as superhero Aldar, also made a cameo appearance as himself on the Australian soap opera Neighbors, and featured in the comedy-drama Relative Strangers.</p><p>His transition to the screen was not without challenge, as he faced discrimination due to his size and wrestling background. In 2010, he was offered a role in the action movie Wrong Side of Town (which he nailed), alongside rapper <a href=#>Ja Rule</a>.</p><p>However, it was James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy that brought Bautista global fame. The renowned director said in an interview that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once he saw the former WWE Champion's audition tape</a> with <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>, he could not imagine anyone else playing Drax.</p><p>Back in 2015, Yahoo! described the scene in question:</p><p>[Bautista and Pratt] act out [a] moment early in the film when Drax has hold of Gamora (eventually played by Zoe Saldana). [Drax] has every intention to — you guessed it — destroy her. It’s a good thing [Pratt's character] Quill is quick to incentivize the mammoth, tatted-up green guy to keep her alive. (Note: Drax appears decidedly more grey than green in the audition tape. We’re assuming his Drax-lite look gave writer-director James Gunn enough to go on to inform his final casting decision.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bautista's performance as Drax was lauded by critics and fans. In addition to his work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Bautista also starred in other successful films like Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead (2021), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), and Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018).</p><p>He played Mr. Hinx in the James Bond film Spectre and starred in a reboot of 1989's Kickboxer, and his performance as Duke in Knives Out earned him high praise.</p><p>Bautista reprised his role as Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), before eventually bidding farewell to the character in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023).</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=row><p>Dave Bautista's Film Appearances</p></th><th scope=col><p>Movies</p></th><th scope=col><p>Worldwide Box Office</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><th scope=row><p>Leading Role</p></th><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>$121,397,587</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Lead Ensemble Member</p></th><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>$8,022,589,343</p></td></tr><tr><th scope=row><p>Supporting</p></th><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>$1,751,440,272</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chris-pratt-net-worth.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Here's How Chris Pratt Earns And Spends His $90 Million Fortune</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Chris Pratt lives a rather luxurious life with his big, fat fortune.</span><p>Dave Bautista owes his success to his talent, work ethic, and comedic skill. His versatility as an actor earned him various roles, from the lovable hunk Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy to the no-nonsense zombie-slaying Scott Ward in Army of the Dead.</p><p>Bautista's prowess knows no bounds, and his filmography has resulted in consistently good returns at the box office. He has appeared in a leading <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">role in 13 movies, earning $121 million</a> at the box office.</p><p>Moreover, his influence extends to a technical role (as a producer and co-producer) in four films that grossed $27 million combined.
