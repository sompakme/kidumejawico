For example, a former sheriff and a former head of the Mississippi Department of Corrections were housed at Seagoville as of 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_a-former-friend-of-josh-duggar-s-was-shocked-to-be-called-as-a-witness-but-proved-josh-s-story-didn-t-add-up-_bk_a2_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="A Former Friend Of Josh Duggar's Was Shocked To Be Called As A Witness (But Proved Josh's Story Didn't Add Up)">A Former Friend Of Josh Duggar's Was Shocked To Be Called As A Witness (But Proved Josh's Story Didn't Add Up)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A former friend of Josh Duggar's was called as a witness, and his testimony may have proven that Josh was lying.</p><p>The point Accurso seemed intent on making was that the "sex offender prisons" are actually some of the safest for high-profile people since the media is keeping an eye out for any news or infractions.</p><p>As far as how Josh is behind bars, though inmate Accurso admitted he hadn't personally met Josh Duggar, he heard about him from a friend and saw him one time. The friend said Josh was a "regular, nice guy," but "everybody was trying to talk to him."</p><p>Accurso said he saw Duggar doing a workout video, but they didn't interact at the time. As far as reputations go, however, Duggar seemed well-liked, though uninterested in "trying to build [his] brand" behind bars.</p><h2 id=critics-were-unimpressed-with-the-inmate-39-s-perspective>Critics Were Unimpressed With The Inmate's Perspective</h2><h3 id=josh-duggar-39-s-fellow-inmate-was-also-convicted-of-crimes-similar-to-josh-39-s>Josh Duggar's fellow inmate was also convicted of crimes similar to Josh's</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/anna-might-have-been-blindsided-by-josh-duggar-s-proposal-and-forced-to-say-yes-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Redditors pointed out after reading the inmate's piece, the person defending Josh Duggar was also behind bars for a similar crime; possession of inappropriate material depicting children.</p><p>Anthony Accurso's bio on The Marshall Project website notes that he "is a writer and paralegal who believes carceral punishment only makes the problem of crime worse.

He hangs out with other sex offenders who [think] he's a nice guy."</p><p>One Redditor wrote, "Grossed out by this author, a convicted and imprisoned sex offender, who does not appear to have remorse or understand his own crimes. And who openly fan-girls Josh Duggar."</p><h2 id=fgi-seagoville-is-reportedly-not-as-quot-scary-quot-as-reported>FGI Seagoville Is Reportedly Not As "Scary" As Reported</h2><h3 id=seagoville-may-be-a-high-profile-prison-but-it-39-s-not-lawless>Seagoville may be a high-profile prison, but it's not lawless</h3><p>According to the insider at Seagoville, it "isn’t the violent and scary prison the media made it out to be." Yet Anthony Accurso revealed some other details about Josh Duggar's imprisonment, including some details about the treatment he may or may not be receiving.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The inmate claims that Josh "probably won’t get treatment until the end of his sentence of 12 years and seven months because the BOP isn’t really interested in treating people — they’re just trying to make it appear like they are mitigating the risk that some of us may pose."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/josh-duggar-and-wife-anna.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Do Josh Duggar’s Siblings Ever Visit Him In Jail?&nbsp;">Do Josh Duggar’s Siblings Ever Visit Him In Jail?&nbsp;</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The Duggar family sticks together, but do they visit Josh in jail?</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seagoville's "Sex Offender Management Program" officially includes two different programs</a>, but both appear to be voluntary. It's unclear whether Josh Duggar has committed (or been ordered) to complete any treatment program. There has also been speculation that <a href=#>Josh might be moved to a different prison after he was caught with contraband</a>.</p><p>As one Redditor said of Josh and other inmates like him, "Watching CSA materials is not a victimless crime." This was the stark opposite of what inmate Accurso conveyed in his piece, leading critics to theorize that Josh is living among sympathizers who also don't feel that they are criminals, despite their convictions stating otherwise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrewv8dmm66fl5a%2FbrXSZqOio5Vitq95z6ugrKeeZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-duggar-s-fellow-inmate-claims-josh-is-a-regular-nice-guy-behind-bars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./miguel-bos%C3%A9-bio-wiki-age-net-worth-partner-sons-and-songs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./miguel-bos%C3%A9-bio-wiki-age-net-worth-partner-sons-and-songs.html>Miguel Bos Bio, Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Partner, Sons, and Songs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-to-delete-your-newgrounds-ng-account.html>How to delete your Newgrounds NG account</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-to-delete-your-newgrounds-ng-account.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
